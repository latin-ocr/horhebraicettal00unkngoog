Girdle qt* the city. 63

ceived, if you begin N ehemiah’s delineation at any other place
than where we have. To these may be added, the situation
of 81103111, of which those things, spoken in J osephus and
the Scripturej can in no manner be said, if you reckon it to
be near Sion.

Let us add also the processione of the choir, Neh. xii. 31.
They went up upon the wall, and went forward on the right
hand to the Dung-gate, the Fountain·gate, the city⁸ of David,
&c. ver. 37. Let those words, “ They went forward on the
right hand,'' ver. 31, be observed: which could not be, unless
according to the procession which we have laid down,—-il' so
be they went up on the wall on the inside of the wall, which
it is rough and strange not to think.

The other part of the choir went on the left hand, towards
the south west, and to the gate of Ephraim, and the Old-
gate, and the Fish-gate‚ 8111. ver. 29. Of the gate of Ephraim
nothing was said in the delineation given chap. iii. Men-
tion also is made of it, 2 Kings xiv. 1 3³ where the Comer-
gate is also spoken of 3 concerning which, also, here is nothing
said.

In Nehemiah, seems to be understood that place, where
formerly was a gate of that name,——but now, under the
second Temple, was vanished.

“anmnnb is it called mount Moriah. ² R. Levi Bar
Ghama and R. Chaninah differ about this matter. One
saith, ΠΝἿἸΠ mm: ΝΣΨΦ, Because thence instruction should
go forth ιο Israel. The other saith, n‘mm nimi-2¹7 ΝἿἸὮΦ,
Because thence should go forth soar to the nations of the
world.’'

“ Ite is a tradition d received by all, that the place, where
David built an altar in the threshing-floor of Araunah, was
the place where Abraham built his, upon which he bound
Isaac, · where Noah built his, when he went cut of the ark. ·
