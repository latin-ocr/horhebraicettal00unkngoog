did, but was swallowed up under the name of Arabia), then,
by way os distinction, it was called Ἰδουμαῖοι Μεγάλη, “ Great
Idumeaf.” [dumea the Less, or the NeW, is that which we
are secking, and concerning which St. Mark speaks, no small
part of J udea 3—so called either from its nearness to Idumea
properly so called, or because of the Idumeans that travelled
thither and possessed it, and that became proselytos to the
law and manners of the Jews. Such a one was Herod As-
calonita. When, therefore, it is said by the evangelist,
that “ a great multitude followed J esus from Galilee, and
from Judea‚ and from Jerusalem, and from Idumea,’' he
speaketh either of the Jews inhabiting that part of J udea,
which, at that time, was called Idumea,—or at least of the
Idumeans, who inhabited it, being now translated into the
religion of the Jews. Gonoerning the country now con-
tained under that name, we shall speak by and by, following,
first, Pliny’s footsteps a little, from the place where he sets
out his progress,—-namely, from Pelusium.

δεον. ΙΙ.-Α few thinys os Pelusium.

Iu Ezek. xxx. 15, 16, pt? Sin, in the Vulgar interpreter
is ‘ Pelusium :’ which the Latin interpreter of the Chaldee
paraphrast follows there: nor without good reason. For
ΓΟ Sin, and pto Tin, among the Chaldees, is Mna. See the
Targum upon Isa. lvii. 21. And ‘ Pithom' and ‘ Raamses’
(Exod. i. ιι), in the Targums of Jerusalem and Jonathan‚
are 3³0³½³07 0³2& Tanis aad Pelueimn: thence those two gates
of Nile, the ‘ Tanitio’ and the ‘ Pelusiae.) in Ptolemy aud
the maps. But nOW, that country or place, which the Sy-
rians and Chaldeans call Sin, that is, Muddy,—the Greeks
call Pelusium, from Πηλὸς, Mad. And who sees not- that
Tanis is derived from ζ’·το Tin ?

And ε here, for the sake of learners, let me observe, that
Pelusium is called in the Talmudists‚ N³pmwp; which who
