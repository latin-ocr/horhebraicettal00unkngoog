“ The aseent of Beth-horon was a strait plaee; nor was there
room to bend to the right hand or to the left.”

The story of Cestius, the Roman captain, in J osephus‚ is
sad, but not unseasonable in this plaee. Hez intrenehed .
against Jerusalem, in a plaoe called the Scope (ἐπὶ τοῦ καλου-
μένου Σκοποῦ), on the north part of the city (whieh we shall
show hereafter): and being at length soroed by the Jews to
retreat, μόγις εἷς Γαβαὼ κατήντησαν ἐπὶ τὸ πρότερον στρατόπε-
δον, “ he came near to Gabaon, to his former eamp.'’ And
being pressed farther by them, he betook himself to Beth-
horon; Προῆγε τὴν δύναμιν ἐπὶ Βαιθώρας, “ He led his forces
to Beth-horon.”

“ But the Jews, whilst he marched along places where
there was room, did not mueh press him; Συνειληθέντων δὲ
εἷς κατὰ στενὰ κατάβασιν· but they getting before the Romans
who were shut up within the straits of the deseent (of Beth-
horon)‚ stopped them from going out: others thrust them
that came in the rear down into the valley. And the whole
multitude being spread ὑπὲρ τὸν αὐχένα τῆς ὁδοῦ, at the
opening of the way, covered the army with their darts.’'

Behold! the way leading from Jerusalem to Beth-horon:—

Ι. From the city to Seopo (ΒἿΞῚΕ of which we shall speak

afterward), is seven furlongS. For so Josephus‚ Διέχει δὲ
ἑπτὰ τῆς πόλεως σταδίους.

II. From Scope to Gabao‚ or Goba, forty-th1·ee furlongs.
For Gabao was distant from Jerusalem, the same J osephus

relating it, fifty furlongs,—that is, six miles and more.
III. From Geba to Beth-horon fifty furlongs, or there-

aboutS. And about Beth-horon was a very great roughness
of hius, and a very narrow passage.
