Momm-inq osma land by dim. 263

They feign1, that Saul in one day travelled sixty miles,
as the Israelites did also from Jordan to mount Gerizim: but
most commonly they judge the diet to be according to what
was said, namely, that under it are comprehended thirty
miles.

And hither let those passages be brought. ἾἿἾ ΝἯ u Ἣ
ΠΡἸΠἿ* ‘What ‘¹¹ is a long way. ² 'm nur-nnn 30 From
Modim” (the sepulchres of the Maccabees)‘ ‘and forward;
and, according to this measure, on every side. He saith,
moreover: From Modim to Jerusalem were fifteen miles.''
The dispute is upon that, Numb. ix. 10, where it is com-
manded, that every one keep the Passover in the first mouth,
unless he be unclean, ΠΡἸΠἾ ἾἿἻἎ 'tt-2 “ 01* in a· long way ;’'
and it is concluded, that by a &my way is to be understood
the distance of fifteen miles at the least, which was the half

ing something found? R. Judah saith, Three fcasts, and
seven days after the last feast: namely, three days for any to
go home to seek whether he hath lost any thing, and three
days to come back [to Jerusalem} and that still one day
might remain for public outcry.'’ (The Gloss is, ‘ That he
might make an outcry,—I lost such a thing, and these are
the marks of it.’) “ But they object, the third day of the
month Marchesvan they pray for rains. Rabban Gamaliel
saith, The seventh of that mouth, which is the fifteenth day
from the Feast of Tabernacles: namely, that the last of all
the Israelites [who came up to the feast] might go to Euphra-
tes, and not be caught by the rains.”

It is presumed by this tradition, that the utmost bounds of
the land of Israel was within three days' journey⁰ of Jeru-
salem : nor amiss: and under the same condition the utmost
bounds of the land beyond Jordan are reckoned; namely,
that they exceeded not that distance; but how much they
