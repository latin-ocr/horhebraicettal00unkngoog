Enyannim. 313

differing in some circumstances. ‘⁶ There ⁰ was another fight
botwixt the Galileans and Samaritans; κατὰ γὰρ τὴν Γήμαν κα·
λουμένην κώμην, ἥτις ἐν τῷ μεγάλῳ πεδίῳ κεῖται τῆς Σαμαρείτιδος·
For hard by a town called Gema, situated in the great plain
of Samaria, multitudes of Jews going up to the feast, there
was a certain Galilean slain.”

It is not much worth our examining whether this be one
and the same story with the other, or whether this Gema be
the same town with Nain: but this we may gather hence,
that Nain was in the extreme borders of Issachar‚ touching
upon the Samaritan country, and Gema in the ex'treme
borders of Samaria that were next adjoining to Issaohar.
And when the Galileans went down from Nain, a town in
lssachar‚ into the great plain of Samaria, the first town
in their way is Gema, there the enemy meets and fights

them: if at least Gema and Nain be not one and the same
place.

S Ec'r. IIL—Enyannim.

Tanna is a great inclination in me to believe that Naim
is the same with Engannim‚ mentioned J osh. xix. 21, xxi. 29.
For, 1. Both of them were within the tribe of Issachar3 En-
gannim, as the Holy Scriptures, and Nain‚ as the Jewish
doctors tell us; and why we should not take their word in
such a thing as this, Ι know no reason. 2. Both of them
signify pleasantness: Naim, in the very etymon, implies plea-
samma: and Engannim, α fountain αἴραν-ἄοικα. 3. The En· .
gannim, mentioned J osh. xxi. 29, in 1 Chron. vi. 73, is 0222

Auem. Now if you transpose the letters (as is done in Γῆς
and 0213) q, it will be 0272 Naim. 4. Let me add that En-

gannim <if there be any credit to those guides that commonly
shew these places to travellers) lies direotly in the way going
from Galilee to J erusalem; and so, as is very evident, was
our Naim. of this place, thus our countryman Biddulphp:
“ a town, commonly called J enine, of old Engannim ε exceed-

ingly pleasant, abounding with waters and gardens, and de-
lightsome walks.”
