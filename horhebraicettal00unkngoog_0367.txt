The situation οἰ meante G'mizim and Ebal, . 357

‘ Euphrates’ as washing some place called ‘ Salmaah) Pto-
lemy, in his chapter concerning the situation of Arabia
Deserta, mentions Salma³‚ in degr. 78. 20. 28. 30: and it is
numbered among-st six-and-twenty other cities, which he
saith are ἑν τῇ μεσογείᾳ, which the Latin interpreter translates
‘ Juxta Mesopotamiam,’ ⁴ near Mesopotamia.’ lf this be true,
the Samaritan version hath something by which it may de- ‘
send itself ε fer if those cities mentioned by Ptolemy were
indeed ‘ Juxta Mesopotamiam,' ‘ near Mesopotamia' (the river
Euphrates only running between), then may the Samaritan
version be warranted while it rendere ‘⁶ even ιο the river Eu-
phrates,” “ even ιο the river of Salmaah‚” that is, “ to the
river Euphrates in that place where it washeth the sides of

Salma.’'

Secr. 11[.-T}ae situation of tho mounts Gerizim and Ebat.
The Samaritam teoet upon Dent. xxvii. 4 noted.

Tru-r Sychar is the same place with Sychem, seems be-
yond doubt3 which, indeed, the mount Gerizim pointed to
by the Samaritan woman, sufficiently confirms. A wily ar·
gument, perhaps, in Epiphaniusts esteem, wh0, in his Sama-
ritan heresy, gives us this account ε

Τῷ γὰρ βουλομένῳ ἀκριβῶς περὶ τοῦ ὄρους Γαριζεὶν ἐρευνᾶσθαι,
ἰστέον ὅτι πρὸς τῇ Ἰεριχῷ κεῖνται τὰ δύο ὄρη, τό τε τοῦ Γαριζεὶν
καὶ τὸ τοῦ Γεβὰλ πέραν τοῦ Ἰορδάνου, πρὸς τῇ ἀνατολῇ τῆς Ἰεριχῶ,
ὡς ἔχει τὸ Δευτερονόμιον, καὶ Ἰησοῦ τοῦ Ναυῆ ἦ βίβλος· “ There
are two mounts near Jericho beyond Jordan, Gerizim and
Ebal, which look towards J ericho on the east,” &m So that,
we see, he tells us Gerizim and Ebal were near J ericho, not
near Sychem. So also before him, Eusebius ‘ de Locis He-
braicis, ⁹ at least, if he be the author of that book, as Petavius
noteth.

That clause ³725& lym„ ‘-over -against Gilgal,” Deut. xi 30,
hath deceived these authors in that manner, that they have
removed the mounts Gerizim and Ebal to Gilgal by J ericho
and it hath, on the other hand, deceived some in that manner,
that they have brought Gilgal by J ericho to Sychem, mis-
understanding the word Gilyal for that place mentioned in

¹ Leusden's edition, vol. ii. p. 586.
