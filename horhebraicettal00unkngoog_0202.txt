the inner parts of the cave four cubits‚ and six cubits; and
let him open within it 3³:52 ’Π eight sepulchres.'' They were
not wont, say the Glosses‚ to bury men of the same family
here and there,⁴ scatteringly‚ and by themselves, but altoge-
ther in one cave: whence, if any one sells his neighbour a
place of bui-iai, he selle him room for two caves, or hollows
on both sides, and a floor in the middle. ἾἿ) is the very
place where the dead corpse is laid.

The tradition goes on: ζκῧῃ pm: '2 “ Three sepulchra
are on this eido, and three on that, and two near them. And
those sepulchres are four cubits long, seven high, and six
broad.''

To those that entered into the sepulchral cave, and carried
the bier, there was first a floor, where they stood, and set
down' the bier, in order to their letting it down into the se-
pulchre: on this and the other side, there was a cave, or a
hollowed place, deeper than the floor by four cubits, into
which they let down the corpse‚ divers coffins being there
prepared for divers corpses. “ R. Simeon saith, The hollow
of the cave consiste of six cubits‚ and eight cubita, and it
opens thirteen sepulchres within it, four on this side and
four on that, and three before them, and one on the right
hand of the door, and another on the left. And the floor
within the entrance into the cave consiste of a square, ac·
cording to the dimensione of the bier, and of them that bear
it: and from it, it opens two caves, one on this side, and
another on that. R. Simeon saith, Four at the four sides of
it. Rabban Simeon Ben Gamaliel saith, The whole is made
according to the condition of the ground.”

These things are handled by the Gemarists and Glossers
very curiously and very largely, whom you may consult.
From these things now spoken, you may more plainly under-
stand many matters which are related of the sepulchre of
our Saviour. Such as these:

Mark xvi. 5: “ The women, entering into the sepulchre,
saw a young man sitting on the right hand :” in the very
floor‚ immediately after the entrance into the sepulchre.

Lukeg xxiv. 3: “ Going in they found not his body‚” dvc.
Ver. 5: “ While they bowed down their faces to the earth
