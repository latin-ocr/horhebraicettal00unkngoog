mma “ Trachon, which is bounded at Bozra.” Not Boz-
rah of Edom, Isa. lxiii. 1 ς nor Bezer of the Reubeuites, J osh.
xx. 8.·, but another, to wit, Bosorra, or Bosor, in the land of
Gilead. Concerning ⁸ which, see J osephus t, and the First
Book of Maccabeos, v. 26.

While we speak of the differenee between Bezer aud Boz-
rah, we cannot pass by a simple example of this thing, pro-
pounded by the Babylonian Talmudists. “ The ¹¹ prince of
Rome'' [viz. Samaei, the angel of death, as the Gloss tells
us] “ did formerly commit a threefold error 3 as it is written,
‘ Who comes from Edom, with dyed garments from Bozrah 3’
In this matter he errs, because there is uo refuge but in Be-
zer, and he betook himself to Bozrah,” &a

Βαταναία ὡρίζετο τῇ Τραχωνίτιδι, “ Batanea is bounded by
Trachonitis ¹.”

Auranitis.—Josephus Υ sometimes calls it ‘ Abranitis.’—
“ Oaesar (saith he) gave to Herod [the Great] Τράχωνα, καὶ
Βαταναίαν, καὶ Ἀβρανῖτιν· Trachon, and Batanea, and Abra-
nitis ;'' and that, that he should restrain and subdue the rob-
bers, who most miserably vexed those countries, 810.
