Tho req-ion qs Decapdis. 251

‘ For perhaps one of the other days is the sabbath.’] R.. Aki-
bah answered, ΠὉῬ ῘἹἾΩἎΟ ἾΠΞ The sabbatio river will
prove this. Wffi' :72⁵2 ¹:⁸2⁹: He that laath a python, (or α
familiar apim) will provo this. rw* uns ’τω ¹ napi And
the sepulchro of lais father will prove thia? The Gloss writes
thus: “ ' The Sabbatic river will prove this! That is a rocky
river, which flows and glides all the days of the week, but
ceaseth and resteth on the sabbath. ‘ He that hath a python
or a familiar spirit, will prove this.’ For a python aseendeth
not on the sabbath-day.· And the sepulchre of Turnus Rufus,
all the days of the year, sent forth a smoke3 because he
was judged and delivered to fire. But transgressore in hell
rest on the sabbath-day.” Therefore‚ his sepulchre sent not
forth a smoke ou the sabbath day.

Do you not suspect. reader, whence and wherefore this
fable was invented! namely, when the brightness of the
Christian sabbath was now risen, and increased every day,
they had recourse to these monsters either of magio or os
subies, whereby the glory of our sabbath might be obscured,
and that of the Jews exalted. The various, and indeed con-

trary relations os historians bring the truth of the story
into suspicion.
