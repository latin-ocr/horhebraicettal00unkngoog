 

Both—harah. 333

This river at length discharged itself into Jordan, above the
bridge or passage that led into Perea. When, therefore,
the Midianites lay on the northern bank of this river, and
so were not capable of attaining the passage over Jordan,
till they had made through these waters first, it was the
Ephraimites’ care and business to maintain the opposite
bank, and that indeed all the whole space from the place
where the fight began, to Beth-harah and Jordan, that the
enemy might be blocked up from all possibility of escape or
retiring. ,

whether, therefore, this passage, of which we have spoken,
was called Beth-harah from that place so near Jordan, or
ΠἾΞΨ rw: Bethabara, from the etymology before mentioned,
it is no absurdity for the further bank of Jordan, which lay
contiguous to the bridge or passage over it, to be called
“ Beth-harah beyond J ordan‚'' either upon the one or the
other account. For (however the learned Beza comes to
question it) the Lexicons will tell you, that πέραν τοῦ Ἰορδάνου
signifieth beyond Jordan .· especially that common three-
fold division, ‘sm-1 um &³¹:2³ rrum u sudes, ennea, and
beyond J ordan.” Ἀπ’ ἀνατολῶν ποταμοῦ Ἰορδάνου· “ On the
east of the river Jordan ;” as Ptolemy expresseth it: and
Beza himself confesseth, that trans Jordanom, beyond Jordan,
is the proper signification of the Greek word πέραν, beyond,
Matt. iv. 15·

Let us, therefore, plwe the Beth-abara we are seeking for,
where John was baptizing, on the further side of Jordan, in
the scythopolitan country, where the Jews dwelt amongst
the Syro -Grecians, as in all the Decapolitan regions, where
Christ might something more safely converse, from the vex-
ations of the scribes and Pharisees, John x. 40, being, as it
were, out of their reach and jurisdiction there. And so we
find John baptizing, first, at the passage of J ericho, because,
through the greatness of the road, there was always a oonsi-
derable concourse of people; and next, at the passage of Scy-
thopolis, for the same reason.

Further, had 1 either leisure or will to play any longer
about the word Βηθανία, we might suppose it written 15³2
&³:817 Both-aonia, which, in the Syriae idiom (amongst whom
it is no unusual thing to change lv into y), agrees with rw:
N'va Bethshaniak. .
