THE PREFAGE.

AMONG all those, who have either publisbed their own cho-
rographical tables of the land of Canaan, or have corrected
others,——you can hardly find any, that have consulted with
the writers of the Talmud in this matter: whereas, certainly,
their consent is by no means in this case to be despised, if,
indeed, it be not rather especially to be regarded.

For, besides that they, above all other men, do most
curiously inquire of the affairs and of the places of that land,
—all the doctore of the Misna, and the Gemarists also of
Jerusalem, were inhabitants and dwellers there: and not a
few also of those of Babylon well viewed it 3 eyewitnesses3
and who (any reader being judge) could not but have, beyond
all others, a most familiar knowledge of that land, dwelling
in it: and not only so, but being such as thought themselves
bound, by a religious necessity, to inquire after the situation
and nature of the places in that land, and to trace them
out with au exact search and curiosity.

Let reason, therefore, determine, whether they, above all
others, are, either justly >or prudently, cast aside in the busi-
ness of chorography3 whether, among all the means used
for the correcting and polishing this, the means that the
Talmud ufforde, should, with any merit or equity, be only
refused? Why the J ewish chorography of the J ewish country
should not be admitted! Certainly, it is unjust, out of pre-
judice‚ to reject, or out of ignorance not to entertain, those
things, which either might yield us the profit of the choro—
graphy of that land, or stir up no unprofitable search into it.
If a man would engrave maps of Palestine, surely it is very
fit, t-hat he should, together with others, consult those authors,
as being the nearest witnesses, inhabiters of the country, and
such as most studiously and most religiously describe it.
And though you esteem them not worthy of credit, because
