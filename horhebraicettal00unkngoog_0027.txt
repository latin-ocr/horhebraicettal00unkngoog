sooner believe, that there were two Zoars, than I should be-
lieve, that the father of the Moabites were not conceived and
born near Zoar of the land of Moab. See Isa. xv. 5.

“ On the western shore'' (of the Asphaltites) “ dwell the
Essenes; whom persons, guilty of any crimes, fiy from on
every side. A nation it is that lives alone, and of all other
nations in the whole world, most to be admired; they are
