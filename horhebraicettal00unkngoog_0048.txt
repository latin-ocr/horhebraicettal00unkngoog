38 Choroyraphioal century.

'summ ln Acrabatta on the north; ΞἾὩΕΠ p> Ἧι) Lydda
on the west; and Jordan on the east.'’ The Gloss3 “ The
wise men appointed, that the second tenth of the fruits‚
growing within the space of a day's journey from Jerusalem,
should be carried thither to be eaten, and should not be
redeemed: ἾῘΔῺΙΊ ’‘1: &a That the streets of Jerusalem
might be crowned with fruits.”

When you consider this distance, you may well wonder
what that means, which is almost become a proverb, “ Thes
women of Lydda knead their dough, go up to the Temple,
pray, and come back. before it be leavened.'’ Not that the
distance of the places is made less3 but that hence may be
shewn, that no disadvantage accrued to these women, who
paid their vows and performed their religion.

I very much wonder, that the authors of the maps have
held Lod and Lydda for two towns; Lod not far from Jordan
and J ericho ; Lydda not far from the Mediterranean sea. A
J ew, or one versed in J ewish affairs, will laugh at these
things; when Lod and Lydda have no difference at all
between them,—-unless that that is Hebrew,—this, Greek.

When the Sanhedrim sat in J abneh‚ there flourished emi-
nent schools in Lydda. Yea, Lydda had her schools and
her learned men, when the university was gone away into
Galilee, and J abneh lamented her loss of scholars.

There R. Akibah bore the headship of the school, removed,
as l said before, from bis government by Rabban Gamaliel,
“ becauseh he detained at Lydda more than forty pair of ἰ
men travelling’' (towards J abneh) “ to give their testimony to
the Sauhedrim concerning the new moon 3 and suffered them
not to go forwards.’'

Gamaliel being dead, or rather removed,——when R. Akibah
was head in J abneh, R. Tarphon was rector of the school
of Lydda, whom you have sometimes disputing with R. Aki-
bah, but at last yielding to him with this commendation;
‘⁴ He that separates himself from you, is as if he separated
himself from his own life.''
