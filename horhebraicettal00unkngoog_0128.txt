A Guthean is as an Israelite in all things. R. Lazar, The
tradition is concerning the heathend, not concerning the

with the Israelites‚ are not to be believed concerning the
putting away of leaven. R. J osah saith, This is to be under-
stood os them as to their houses; but as to their courts, they
may be suspected: for so they interpret, ‘ Leaven shall not
be found in your houses 3’ not, ‘ in your courts.'-—It is a tra-
dition. Rabban Simeon Ben Gamaliel saith, In whatsoever
precept the Gutheans converse, they are more accurate in it
than the Israelites. This is to be understood, saith R. Simeon,

who said, wrm: urps-sm τήνω ”2³ “ Thirteenf ciues were

the Jews. Whatsoever that is, it is clear certainly, both
hence and elsewhere, that the Samaritans sometime did dwell
together with the Jews, being here and there sprinkled among
them, and the Jews here and there among the Samaritans.
Certainly that is worthy of observing which J osephus relatos
of Herod’s rebuilding Sebaste, heretofore called Samaria:
