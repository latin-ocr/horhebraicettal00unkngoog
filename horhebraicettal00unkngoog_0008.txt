was included in the new edition of his works ρ

(13 vols„ 8vo. London, 1822-5)‚ superintended by
the Rev. John Rogers Pitman, M. A. Τ1131 edition
has now become scarce and expensive3 and besides,
contains much matter less interesting to modern
readers. It seemed therefore desirable that the
Horoe Hebraicoe should be rendered accessible to
theological students by being published alone.

The present edition has been printed, from Mr.
Pitman's ;. but wherever a passage seemed obscure,
not only the folio edition, but the original Latin
also has been consulted. Thus the text has been

carefully revised throughout, and alterations made ’

111 many places. Upon the Hebrew quotations much
attention has been bestowed. Very many correc-
tions were required here, and though from the simi-
larity of some Hebrew letters, and other causes, the
Editor can hardly hope that he has overlooked no

, errors, yet he can say that he has spa-red no pains

to secure accuracy.
For the more convenient distribution of the work,

the Geographical matter, which the Author prefixed

to each Gospel‚ has in this edition been brought
together in one volume.
