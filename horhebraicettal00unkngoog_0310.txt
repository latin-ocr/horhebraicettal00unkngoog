last I presumo most probable; and so we place Trachonitis
in the extreme parts of the Transjordanine country towards
the east. And both which, upon these reasons taken to-
getiliegfhe Gemarists, describing the circumference of the land
from the north, do mention p: ΠιῦὩΌΒἻ ΠΝΒΨ ᾺῙῚἸᾸΞἾΙἾ

the upper, which is above Oaesarea [Philippi], and Trachona,

which extends to Bozraht:” where the extension of Trachona
must not be understood of its reaching to some Bozrah in
those northern borders3 but to some Bozrah or Bosorrah in
the confines of Pereau: and so it supposes the country ex-
tending itself from the north towards the south.

2. Βαταναίας’ι χώρας, “ Of the province of Batanea; east
of which is Saccea, and here, under the hill Alsadamus, are
the Trachonite Arabiane? Behold here the Trachonites living
east of Batanea. -

νῖτις· “ The country of Gamala, and Gaulanitis, and Batanea,
and Trachonitis.'' But were not Gamalitica itself and Gaulo-
nitis within Batanea? Right: but by this distinction he divides
between that Batanea that was nearer Galilee, and that that
was farther off. That country that lay nearest, from those
noted towns of Gaulan and Gamala, he calls Gaulonitis and
Gamalitica3 and that which was farther off, he calls by its
own name of Batanea3 and what lies still beyond that, Tra-
chonitis.

There was a time when all that whole country, which now
is distinguished into these severals, had one general name of
Bashan ,- which word, how it came to change into Bathan, or
Batanea‚——as also, with the Targumists and Samaritam, into
Bathnin and Mathnin,——any one, indifferently skilled in the
Syrian tongue‚ will easily discern.
