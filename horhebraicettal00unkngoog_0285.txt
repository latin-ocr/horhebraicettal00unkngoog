citiam qt‘tlte city of Ono, eminent among the Rabbins‚ “ one
of the five learned who judged before the wise men. These
were Ben Azzai, Ben Zuma‚ Chanan‚ and Ohananiah, and
Ben Nanas.''

Why the maps placed Lod and Ono near Jordan, not far
from J ericho, I can meet with no other reason than that in
Josephns is found the town Adida, not far from thence, and
Hadid is rechoned with Lod and Ono in Ezra ii. 33³ and Lod
and Hadid are framed into⁸ one word Λοδαδὶ, Βοιίαάί, Ezra
ii. 33, and Λοδαδὶδ, Lodadid, Neh. vii. 37, by the Seventy in·
terpreters. But there were more places called by the name of
Adida3 so that that reason fails, if that were the reason. For
there was Ἀδιδᾶ ἐν τῇ Σεφήλᾳ, ‘Adida in Sephel,' (‘ Adida in
the valley) ς’ and ⁸, Ἀδιδὰ πόλις ἐπ’ ὄρους· κειμένη, “ The city
Adida in the mountain3 ὑφ’ ἧς ὑπόκειται τὰ τῆς Ἰουδαίας πεδία·
under which lie the plains of Judea.” And b “ Adida in
Galilee before the great plain,’' if<² it were not the same with

among other places3 “ When the tyrant [or Trajan] endea-

brother wpff'ffin in Locum, &03⁹ [the (41083,Ἧὲ N’fl ΝῬἾἹῙΏ
Lodicea, that is, Lydda] “ he said to them, If you are of the
people of Ananias, Michael‚ and Azarias, let your God come,
and deliver you out of my hand.”

The martyrdom of these brethren is much celebrated, which
they underwent for the king's daughter, who was found
slain; and the enemies of the Jews said that the Jews had
elain her; and these brethren, to deliver Israel, said, ‘ We
slew her ;’ therefore those alone the king slew. So the
