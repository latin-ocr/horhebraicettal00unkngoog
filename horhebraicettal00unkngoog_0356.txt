Why d, therefore, did those interpretem take the word in
two, when it was plain and etymological enough of itself 3
“ The Syriae Jon brings to mind a passage of Eustathius
upon this verse of Dionysius ε

Ἦν τε καὶ Ἰονίην περιναίεται, ηὐδάξαντο.

“ Some say, saith he, that that whole sea from Gaza as
far as Egypt, is called the Ionian sea, from lo.” Καὶ τὴν
ἐκεῖ δὲ Γάζαν Ἱόνην καλοῦσί τινες· ἔνθα βοῦς ἦν ἑν ἀγάλματι
τῆς Ἰοῦς, ἤτοι τῆς Σελήνης· “ Indeed‚ some call even Gaza
itself Ione, where there is a heifer in the image of Ic, or the
moon.''

Tha-t Gaza was ever called Ione, is not commonly known;
but grant it was, and the sea, from that place even as far as

Egypt, to have been called the Ionian sea3 yet should not Ι ,

have derived its name from ‘ 10‚’ but rather from the ‘ Iones,'
those brassy robust men, of whose coming into Egypt, and
fixing their scats there by the sea, Herodotus ⁰ gives us a
famous relation.

But must we seek for 15³ νγ ein Jon (or Jnvnn, as some
would have it) hereabouti To seek John about Gaza, would
be to seek him out cf the land of Israel; at least, as the
bounds of that land were at that time determined.

Ir AEnon was the place where John baptized last, imme-
diately before his imprisonment, then we must look for it
either in Galilee or Perea: for in one of those places it was
where he began his acquaintance with Herod. For however
St. Luke‚ speaking of Herod, mentions Galilee only within
his tetrarchy‚ Luke iii. 1, yet J osephus tells us f, that Ἐγέ.
νετο ὑπὸ τούτῳ [Ἀντίπᾳ] ἥ τε Περαία καὶ Γαλιλαία, “ both
Perea and Galilee were under his jurisdiction.'' Where
then shall we begin his first acquaintance with the Baptist3
I had once inclination to have fixed it in Galilee3 but whilst
I consider better that Herodium was in Perea, and very
near Machaerus, J ohn's prison, that seems the more probable.

J osephus ε, speaking of Herod the Great and his stately
buildings, bath this amongst other things: Φρούριον {mret-
