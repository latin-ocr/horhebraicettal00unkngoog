The reffl’on qs Decapolis. 253

samed cities os Galilee sor cities of Decapolis, when, both in ‚
sacred and profane authore, Galilee is plainly distinguished
from Decapolis. ln Pliny, it seems an unequal match to
join Damascus and philadelphia, formerly the two metropoles
of Syria and the kingdom of Ammon, with the small cities of
Gadara and Hippo.

With Pliny and his followers Josephus also consents, in
reckoning up some cities os Decapolis. For severely chiding
J ustus of Tiberias, he has these words: Σὺ καὶ πάντες Τιβε·
ριεῖς, οὗ μόνον ἀνειλήφατε τὰ ὅπλα, ἀλλὰ καὶ τὰς ἐν τῇ Συρίᾳ
Δέκα πόλεις ἐπολεμεῖτε· “ Your also and all the men of Tibe-
rias have not only taken up arms, but have fought against
the cities of Decapolis in Syria.'' Observe that: The cities
of Decapolis ἐν Συρίᾳ, in Syn’a, not in Galilee. Σὺ γοῦν τὰς
κώμας αὐτῶν ἑνέπρησας’ “ Thou hast set their cities on fire.”
And a little after, “ After that Vespasian was come to Pto-
lemais, οἱ πρῶτοι τῶν τῆς Συρίας Δέκα πόλεων, tlte chief men (ψ’
Decapolis of Syria sharply accused J ustus of Tiberias, ὅτι
τὰς κῶμας αὐτῶν ἐνέπρησεν, that ke had fired their towns.’'
But what those towns os Decapolis were2. he hints elsewhere
in these words: ‘⁶ Then⁸ J ustus persuading his fellow-citi·
zens to take arms, and compelling those that would not, and
going forth with all these, ἑμπίμπμησι τάς τε Γαδαρηνῶν καὶ
Ἱππηνῶν κώμας, heb fires tlte villayes qf tlte Gadarenes and the
Hippens.’'

You see how, with Pliny, Josephus joins the region of
Decapolis to the side of Syria, and how he reckons Gadara
and Hippo sor Decapolitan towns with him. And yet, as we
said, Pliny doth not please usin all: but that which in him
might seem most ridiculous and absurd‚ namely, that he
reckons Scythopolis, which is beyond Jordan, with the other
cities plesseth me most of all. For from that very city we
are certified what were the other cities, and why they were
of such singular name and note: having first taken notice os
the condition of Scythopolis, it will be more easy to judge os
the rest.
