name signifies.” Perhaps he might at that time think of
ΒΝ mn which imports the “increase of God.”

It would be endless to reckon up such variatione os letters
in proper names3 but as to the letter r, which is our business
at present, take these few instances z

‘ Nebuchadnezzar’ is elsewhere ‘ Nebuchadrezzar ς’ ‘ Belial'
is ‘ Beliar ;' ‘ Shephum,’ by the Greek interpreters, Σεφαμᾶρ,
Sephamar, Numb. xxxiv. 11: so Sychem, Sychar3 and this
so much the rather because the letters r and m have ob-
tained I know not what kind of relation and affinity one
with another. So Dammesek and Darmesek in the Holy

· Scriptures3 and the ‘ Samaritans’ are the ‘ Samatians' in

Dionysius Afer, Sne.

Or, secondly, it might happen that the Jews, by way of
scoff and opprobrium, might vulgarly call Sychem Sychar‚
either that they might stigmatize the Samaritans as ‘ drunk·
arde: lea. xxviii. ι, ‘⁶ woe to the drunkards [ἡβῶ] of
Ephraim 3⁹⁹ or (as the word might be variously writ- and pro-
uounced) might give them some or other disgracesul mark, as
ἾΡΦ signifies prevam’catin93 ἾὉΦ α mercenary or hz‘reliny ‚-
5250 a sepulchre. So Aruch in ³20, 0³52? mma ³³:50
Sochcre, i. e. sepulchra. He quotes a place ¹¹ where the words
are not as they are by him cited3 nor is he consistent with
himself in the interpretation. But Munster hath ἾΞἸΟ a se-
pulchro. If it be thus, perhaps 0:12* Sychem might be called
Sychar, because there the twelve patriarche were buried ,· and
under that notion the Samaritans might glory in that name.
