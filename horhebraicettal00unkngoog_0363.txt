2. Josophm mistakem.

Rabbi Ismail saith ¹, ΕΠ ΠἹἾἿΏ ἿἾἿἎ wrm “ that the Gu-
thites are proselytes of lions.” R. Akiba saith, ζΠ HD& ἾἾὫ
“ that they are true proselytes.” The story of the lions,
2 Kings xvii. 26, is well enough knowm which Josephus 5,
faltering very lamely, reports in this manner3 Ἐκαστοι κατὰ
ἔθνος ἴδιον Θεὸν εἷς τὴν Σαμάρειαν κομίσαντες, πέντε δ’ ἦσαν, καὶ
τούτοις, καθὼς ἣν πάτριον αὐτοῖς, σεβόμενοι, παροξύνουσι τὸν μέ-
γιστον Θεὸν εἰς ὀργὴν καὶ χόλον. Λοιμὸς γᾶρ αὐτοῖς ἑνέσκεψεν,
ὑφ’ οὗ φθειρόμενοι, &a He tells us that as every one brought
their several gods into Samaria, and worshipped them ac·
cordingly, so the great and true God was infinitely displeased
with them, and brought a destructive plague amongst them.
He makes no mention of lions being sent amougst them,
according to what the sacred history relateS. Probably the
story of that horrible destruction upon Sennacherib's army
by a wasting plague, gave the first rise to J osephus's fancy of
a plague amougst the Samaritans3 though it is very odd that
he should have no touch of the lions, being so remarkable a

judgment as that was.

3. Samaria planted with colonias two several times.

There are the colonies which Asnapper is said to have
brought into Samaria, Ezra iv. 10, as well as those by Esar·
haddon, ver. 2.

The Jews do judge² this ‘ Asnapper' to be the same with
⁸ Sennacherib: and that he had eight names. The first syl-
lables of the names, indeed, agree pretty well, Sena and Asua3
but whether they denote the same persons, 1 leave undeter-
mined.

However ⁸, whether this Asnapper was the same with Sen-
nacherib, or Shalmaneser, or some great minister, or the
king's commander·in-chief, in the transplauting of a colony,
it seems evident that Samaria was planted with colonies two
