Ohaldee paraphrasi: and the Rabbins understand this of the
place where the army of the Assyrians perished: nor very
subtilly 3 for they seem ιο have perished, if so be they
perished near Jerusalem, in the valley of Tophet‚ or Ben-
Hinnom‚ Isa. xxx. 33. And J eremiah speaks of that valley,
namely, the sink 81111 burying-place of the city,—a place,
above all others that compassed the city, the most foul and
abominable: foretelling that that valley‚ which now was so
detestable‚ should hereafter be clean, and taken into the com-
pass of the city: but this mystically‚ and in a more spiritual
sense. Hence we argue, that “ the tower of Hananeel” was on
the south side of the city: on which side also was the valley
of Ben-Hinnom3 yet bending also towards the east: 86 ι116
valley of Kidron hent from the east also towards the north.
It will be impossible, unless I am very much mistaken, if
you taken the beginning of that circumference in N ehemiah,
for the corner looking north-east, which some do,—to in-
terpret these words of J eremiah in any plain or probable
sense3 unless you imagine that which is most false,—that the
Valley of Hinnom was situate northwardly.
