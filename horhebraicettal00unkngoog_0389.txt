them? Where are Chalamish and Naveh? Where are (lama
and Chippar3 &c. Let us not, thasium, give ourselves a
needless trouble os mining what there is no hope os finding
απτ, taking notice only thus sar, how miserably the face of
things was changed when there was cause sor this complaint !
For before, J ericho had flourished with great numbers of
Jews, there being twelve thousand of the courses of the
priests, that stood in continual readiness every day ε· but now
it was inhabited wholly by its enemies. So was it wit-h
Lydda once, when it was a most famed school of the Rab-
bins, but now an enemy city. These things are worthy of a
chronological inquiry.

We find only this os ἾΞἾΠ C‘kippar, that it was within

came together to build the city, and he approached to the
wall of the brook, which is on the east; and they repaired

Bethphage was, which was the outmost part of the city

green figs,” from the fig· trees that grew near it in the mount
