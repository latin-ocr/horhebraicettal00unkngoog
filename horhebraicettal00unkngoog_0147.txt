the Jerusalem writers say, ‘⁶ Theyk built sor the daughters of
the Midianites little booths of hurdles from Beth-Jeshimon

unto the mountain of snoW, and placed there women selling
cakes.’'

The Jerusalem Targum upon Num. xxxv. writes thus;

“ The mountain of snow at Caesam-eff (Philippi). See also
J onathan there.

G HAP. LXVII.
ΟἾἾὉΒ Ραππὶαε. Pansa-3, the spring qf Jordan.

Tun maps assign a double spring of J ordan; but by what

right it scarce appears3 much less does it appear by what
right they should call this Jor‚—and that Dan. There is

indeed mention in J osephus of little Jordan and great J or-
dan. Hence, as it seems, was the first original of the double
spring in the maps‚ and os a double river at those first springs.
For thus J osephus3 Πηγαὶ, αἳ τὸν μικρὸν καλούμενον Ἰορδάνην
προπέμπουσι τῷ μεγάλῳ· “ There are fountains (in Daphne)
which send little Jordan, as it is called, into the great.” He
treats, in the text cited, of the lake Samochonitis‚ and saithl,
διατείνει δὲ αὐτῆς τὰ ἕλη μέχρι Δάφνης χωρίου, 810. ‘⁶ That the
fens of it- are extended to the country Daphne, which, as it is
otherwise pleasant, so it contains springs, from which issue
little J ordan,'' Sne.

Riblah (that we may note this by the way) by the Tar-
gumists is rendered Daphne. They, upon Num. xxxiv. 1 1,
for that which is in the Hebrew, “ And the border shall go
down to Riblah,” render it, “ And the berder shall go down
to Daphne. ” See also Aruch in ὌΞΠ Daphne. But this cer-
tainly is not that Daphne os which J osephus here speaks;

which will sufficiently appear by those things that follow.
But as to the thing before us. —

Ι. Both he and the Talmudists assign Panium or Paneas
to be the spring of Jordan, nor do they name another.
