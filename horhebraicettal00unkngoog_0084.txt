'rhet altar was, on every side, two-and-thirty cubite; aster
the ascent of one cubit, it was so straitened, that it was less
by one cubit in the whole square‚—that is, on every side thirty
cubite. It went up five cubitS, and again was straitened a
cubit; so that there it was eight and twenty cubits on every
side. The place of the horne on every part was the space of
one cubit; 8ο that now it was six and twenty cubits every
way. The place of the priests’ walk, hither and thither, was
one cubit; so that the place of burning extended four and
twenty cubits round about.

A scarlet thread begirt the middle of the altar, to discern
between the upper bloods and the lower.

The basis of the altar towards the south-east had no
corner, because that part was not within the portion of
J udah.

At the horn between the west and the south were two
heles, like nostrils, through which the sprinkled blood de·
scended, and flowed into the brook Kedron.

The ascent to the altar was, on the south, two and thirty·
cubits‚ and the breadth sixteen cubits. There ¹¹ was a time,
when, upon this secent, one priest stabbed another priest
with his knife, while they strove who should first get up to
the altar.

On the north were six orders of rings, each of which con-
tained four. There are some who assert there were four
orders, and each contained six, at which they killed the
sacrifices: there, therefore, was the place of slaughter.- N ear
by were low pillars set up, upon which were laid, overthwart,
beams of cedar: in these were fastened iron hooks‚ on which
the sacrifices were hung; and they were flayed on marble
ables, which were between those pillars.

There was a laver or cistern between the porch and the
altar, and it lay a little to the south. “ Ben Kattin ¹ made

. twelve cocks for it, which before had but two. He also
