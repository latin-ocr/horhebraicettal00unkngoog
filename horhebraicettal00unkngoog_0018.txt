“ The · land of Samaria is reckoned clean, and the gathering
together of its waters clean, and its dwellings clean, and its
paths clean :'’ which the J ewish curiosity would by no means
pronounce of a heathen land. But as to many other things,
they made no difference between them and the Gentiles.

The J ewish doctors do, indeed, particularly apply that
division of the three countries in the place alleged, to the
tradition and canon concerning *turm but yet they do every
where retain the same, wheresoever they treat of the divi-
sion of the land of Israel. What ἾἸὩἿΞ means, you may
learn from the authors of the gloss upon the place. Briefly

there any OEdipus at hand, nor Sphinx herself, to explain and

comments here, nor have we the advantage of any other com-
mentator. We must, therefore, act here according to the
uncertain instruction of nods and winks; and that either by
saying nothing, or by mere conjecture, since that the mind of
the authors is either altogether unknown, or it is wholly
doubtful, whether it be known or n0. Expect not, that I go
from street to street to knock at all the gates os these places:
it will be enough, if we can scrape out, in what regions these
places lie, and are able to guess at what points of the heaven

they are disposed. We will at present take in haud only the
