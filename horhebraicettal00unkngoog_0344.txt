Fonasuucn as our evangelist makes only 'a transient men-

heavenly message about the Word being made flesh, doth not
only by a wondrous miracle stand to this day enfin-03 but,
by the ministry of angele, was retrieved from the hands of
infidele, and translated, first into Dalmatia, thence into Italy,
to Loretto in the province of Picenum.'’
