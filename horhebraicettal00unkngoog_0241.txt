1 cannot omit what he saith besides : ‘⁸ Much of the fiesh
which was caten at J erusalem‚” in the time of the feasts,
‘was of'’ the second ‘⁴ tithes. For scarce any one tarried
there until he had eaten an his tithes; but he gave the mo·

city. And, for the most part, with the moneys os the tithes
they bought their thank-ofl'erings.”

sat under the shadow qs tlte Temple, and taught the people the
whole day.'' The Gloss‚ ‘⁸ When the Temple was a hundred
cubita high, it cast its shadow a great way in length, unto
that street which was before ΠΌΠ *m tho Mountain qf the
Homo. And because that street was spacious‚ and might
contain a great multitude os men, Joohanan taught there by
reason of the heat. For no synagogue could contuin his
hearers.”

That street which was before the mount of the Temple,
according to the accustomed form os speech, was that by
which they went to the Temple at the east gate; concerning
which street, and the people convened thither by Hezekiah‚
mention is made 2 Chron. xxix. 4.<¹ This street went out
into the valley of Kedron, by the Water-gate. And this
way the priest went out, that was to burn the red cow in
Olivet. And this way our great HighPriest entered with
palme and Hosanna. This was called “ the Street of the

Temple,” Ezra x. 9. CHAP IV
