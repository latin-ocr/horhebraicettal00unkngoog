pretation. But the Arabic of Erpenius’s edition reads Dal-
manutha.—“ Erasmus notes (saith Beza upon the place),
that a certain Greek copy hath Maydala. And Austin
writes, that most copies have Mayeda. But in our very old
copy, and in another besides, for εἷς r& μέρη Δαλμανουθὰ, ‘into
the parts of Dalmanutha, is written εἰς τὰ ὅρια Μαδεγαδὰ,
‘ into the coasts of Madeyada?

Is the name and situation of Maqdala in the Talmudists
had been known to these interpretem, I scarcely think they
would have dashed upon so many uncertainties. We have
largely and plainly treated of it in another volume, out of
those authors: and out os the same, unless 1 mistake‚ some·
thing may be fetched‚ which may afford light to Mark’s text
of Dalmanutha. Which thing before we take in hand,
perhaps it will not be unacceptable to the reader, if we de-
scribe the sea of Gennesaret, and the places adjoining, by
some kind of delineation, according to their situation, which
we take up from the Hebrew writers.

Commune this my little map with others, since you see it
to differ so much from them, you will expect that 1 sufficiently
prove and illustrate the situation of the places, or I shall come
off with shame. l did that, is my opinion deceive me not, a
good while age, in some chapters in the chorographical cen-
tury. 1 will here despatch the sum total in a few lines:

bank of Gadara, and another part upon the bank of Neph-

thali, or Tiberias, the bridge lying between· which shall be
shewn presently.
