When the Asmoneans had snatched away this city out of
the hand of the Grecians, the name of it was changed into
'witz’ '75:172 ffi'l'l'l& ‘⁸ The taking of the tower Shur,'' as
the Gemarists tell us in the place alleged: or as the author
of J uchasin‚ “ The¹ taking of the tower nix Tzur :”—or as
the Jerusalem Talmudists (unless my conjecture deceives me),
qum ‘77:72⁰‘ “ the tower Sidss’ Whether out of these words
you can make out the name of πύργος Στράτωνος, “ the tower
of Strato‚” it is your part to study3 that certainly was the
denomination of this place before it was called Caesarea.

It was distant six hundred furlongs, or thereabout‚ from
Jerusalem (that is, seventy-five miles), as J osephus relates
in that story of an Essene J ew that prophesied. Who ¹²,
when he saw Antigonae, the brother of Aristobulus, passing
by in the Temple, having been now sent for by his brother
(indeed, that he might be slain by treachery), “O strange!

is distant six hundred furlongs hence: and there remains yet
four hours of day. But the very time makes my prediction

plexed in his thoughts; but by and by news was brought
that Antigonus was slain in a certain place underground0, ἐν
σκοτεινῇ τινι παρόδῳ, “ in a certain dark passage,” which also
was called Στράτωνος πύργος, “ Strato's tower.”

Herod built the city to the honour and name of Caesar, and
made a very noble haven at vast expenses. ΠόλιυΡ πᾶσαν
ἆνέκτισε λευκῷ λίθῳ, καὶ λαμπροτάτοις ἐκόσμησε βασιλείοις, ἓν ᾗ
μάλιστα τὸ φύσει μεγαλόνουν ἐπεδείξατο, &c. “ Hc built all
the city with white stone, and adorned it with most splendid
houses: in which especially he shewed the natural greatnesa
of his mind. For between Dori and J oppa, in the middle of
which this city lay, it happened that all the sea-coast was
destitute of havens, &c He made the greater haven of Pi·
