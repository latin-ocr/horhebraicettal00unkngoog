south part of Jerusalem, and mount Sion is to be reckoned
within the lot of J udah,—how could this be, when J eru-
salem, which was of the lot of Benjamin, lay between Judea
and Sion?

I answer, 1. No necessity compels 118 ιο circumscribe Sion
precisely within the portion of J udah3 when David conquered
it, not as he was sprung of J udah, but as he was the king of
the whole nation.

2. But let it be allowed, that Sion is to be ascribed ιο
J udah,—that dividing line, between the portion of J udah
and Benjamin‚ concerning which we made mention before,
went not from the east to the west3 for 80, indeed, it had
separated all Jerusalem from all Sion: but it went from south
to north, and so it cut Jerusalem in two, and Sion in two:
so that both were in both tribes, —and so also was mount
Moriah.

II. It 18 objected, that, at this day, a hill and ruins are
shown ιο travellers under the name of Sion, and the tower of
David, on the south part of the city.

I answer, But let us have leave not to esteem all things
for eracles, which they say, who now show those places 3
since it is plain enough that they mistake in many other
things: and let it be without au controversy, that they study
11οι 80 11111011 ι1·11ι11 111 that affair, as their own gain. I wish
less credit had been given to them, and more search had been
made out of Scriptum, and other writers, concerning the
situation of the places.

Momm· Sion did not thrust itself so far eastward as mount
Aera: and hence it is, that mount Moriah' 18 said, by J ose
phus, to be‘ ‘situate over· ·against Acra,” rather than over-
against the Upper city. for, describing Acra thus, which we
produced before, ‘'At-epos* δὲ [λόφος] ὁ καλούμενος Ἀκρα, 81οη

“‘There 18 another hill, called Acra, which bears the Lower
Oity upon it, steep on both sides :’' in the next words he sub-
joins this, τούτου δὲ ἆντικρὺ τρίτος ἤν λόφος, “ over-against this
was a third hill,'' speaking of Mol-iah.
