And now let the reader judge whether these were some
of the Decapolitan sities. Whether they were or no, we
neither determine, nor are we much solicitous about it: that

which we chiefly urge is, that, by the plaoes before men·
tioned, it appears, as I suppose, that the eities of Deoapolis
were indeed. within the limits of the land of Israel, but in-
habited by Gentiles. Jews indeed dwelt with them, but
fewer in number, inferior in power, and not so free both in
their possessione and privileges. And if you ask the reason
why they would dwell in suoh an inferiority with the heathens,
take this: “Thou Rabbins deliver. Let one always live in
the land of Israel, though it be in a city the greatest part
of whioh are beathens. And let not a man dwell without
the land, yea‚ not in a city the greatest part of whioh are
IsraeliteS. For he that lives in the land of Israel bath
God; but he that lives without the land is as if he had not
God ς as it is said, ‘To give you the land of Canaan, that
God may be with you,'’' διο. Would you have more reasons?
‘⁶ Whosoever¹ lives within the land of Israel is absolved from
iniquity. And whosoever is buried within the land of Israel
is as if he were buried under the altar.'’ 'Pake one for all:
“ Ther men of Israel are very wise; for the very elimate
