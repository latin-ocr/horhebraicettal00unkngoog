Sinam, in the story of Elijah‚ 1 Kings xvii, 18 written
in Hebrew ΠὲἾξ ΤωνεΡΙιιιτΙι, 81111 with the same letters in
Obad. ver. 20: and therefore it may be reasonably inquit-ed,
whether it be one 8011 1110 same place. Indeed‚ there would
hardly be any doubt 10 11, but that the Jews ordinarily by
ΠὲἿξ, understand France‚· and by ἻἾΞΟ Saphar-ad, which by
the ‘prophet is used in the very 881110 verse, Spain. The
words of the prophet are very variously rendered3 81111 yet
in all that variety, nothing hinders but that Zau-ephath there
may be understood of the Zarephath mentioned in the Kings.
For whether the passage concern the eaptivity's being 110-
1810011 in Zarephath‚ or the captivity’s possessing the land
10 Zarephath (for in that variety chiefly the words are ex-
pounded)‚ in either sense it may well enough be, that the
‘ Sarepta that belongs to Zidon’ may be the 80000 ot* the
affair. As to the former, if we compare but that passage
eonoerning Tyre, the sister of Sidon, Amos i. 9, 8011 withal
the poteney 8011 110111101οο of the Sidonians, it may 001 be
improbable but that the Israelites might be eaptived in
Sarepta 0ss Sidon. And 88 10 1110 181101, whereas in the verse
immediately before, the discourse is of the possession of the
mount of Esau, of the fields of Ephraim, Samaria, and Gilead,
8011 11100 there 18 mention of possessing the 18011 of Canaan

of the places there named, whioh were all very near? Let me
add moreover, that whereas there 18 mention of possessing
the land of the Ganaanites “ even unto Zarephath,” the Greek
interpreters will tell you who those Canaanites were that are
distinguished from the rest of the nations in the 181111 of
Canaan3 viz. the Phoenioians, J osh. v. 1. And by the ‘ kings
