the sea is valley.''’

J udea is not divided amiss into four parts z—namely‚ into
the oountry, which formerly was the Philistines', whioh takes
up the western part. To this joins‚ on the east, the moun· .
tainous oountry of J udea, which is also called ‘⁴ The king's
mount? To the mountainous country, on the east, joins a
plain, a oountry more low and level than the mountains‚
whioh nevertheless here and there hath its hills. Henoe is
that, ’1Πὲῑῖ Πιῖὓῑῖ, 810. “ ΑΥ valley‚ lying between moun-
tains, is reokoned with the mountains, and mountains in a
valley are numbered with the valley.” To to the plain east-
wardly joins a valley, lower than the plain‚—namely‚ the ooast
of the sea of Sodom‚ and at length of Jordan.

Thez land of Benjamin, in like manner, which is numbered

reason of the goodness of the soil‚'' yet had its mountainous
part, its plain, and vale: and that, not only towards Lydda,
and the great sea, but towards J erioho and Jordan.

J udea did exoel all the other parts of the land of Israel in
very many privileges. For, besides that in it was seated J e-
rusalem, the metropolis of the whole nation‚ and in Jerusalem
stood the Temple, and in the Temple sat the Sanhedrim 3-
this was also peculiar to it out of the canons, that “itb was
not lawful to intercalate the year out of J udea, while they
might do it in J udea.’' Maimonides0 gives the reason of the
thing, ‘⁶ Because there dwelt the divine glory.''—“ Nord was
the sheaf of the first-fruits of the barley to be fetohed else-
where, than from J udea, and as near as might be to J eru-
