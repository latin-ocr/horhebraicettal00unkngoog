Hebron.

Fnou J erioho we proeeed to Hebron, far off in situation,
bnt next to it in dignity: yea, there was a time, when it
went before Jerusalem itself in name and honour 3—namely‚
while the first foundations of the kingdom of David were
laid3 and, at that time, Jerioho was buried in rubbisb, and
Jerusalem was trampled upon by the profane feet of the
J ebusitee. ⁶

Hebron was placed, as in the mountainous country of
J udea, eo in a plaoe very rooky, but yet in a very fruitful
coast.

Yon may observo the situation of Hebron, in respect of
Jerusalem, from those things which are related of a daily
euetom and rite in the Temple. ‘⁴ Theb president of the
service in the Temple was wont to say every morning, Go,
and eee whether it be time to kill the sacrifice. If it were
