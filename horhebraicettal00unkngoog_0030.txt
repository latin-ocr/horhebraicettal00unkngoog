came in the fortieth year of their travel,'Num. xx. These,

we suppose, were some of the reasons, whereby the authors
of them were drawn to it.

Ι. Because Kadesh-barnea was in the desert of Paran,
Num. xii. 16. xiv. ι. But the Kadesh, whither they came
the fortieth year, was in the desert of Zin, Num. xx. 1.-1
answer, The searchers of the land, departing from Kadesh-
barnea, are said, als0, to go out os the deserts of Zin, Num.
xiii. 21. Paran was the general name of that dreadful
desert; Zin only one part of it.

ΙΙ. In Kadesh-barnea they encamped many days, Dent.
i. 46. But in that Kadesh, concerning which mention is
made, Num. xx, there was not provision sufficient, whereby
they might be sustained one day. For they complain, that
it was a place altogether destitute of seed, figs, vines, and
pomegranates, Num. xx. 5 ε which they did not at all com-
plain of, while they remained in Kadesh-barnea.—I answer,
omitting, that wheresoever they encamped, they were fed
by manna; the complaint arose among them, not so much of
the place itself, as of the ill boding and prejudice, as I may
so say, of the place; because, from the barrenness of this
place, they prejudged of the like barrenness of that land,
into which they were to enter‚-and the perch, as it were,
of whi‘ch, was Kadesh·barnea. When they came hither
first, now thirty-eight years before, “ Ye came to the moun-

you,” Deut. i. 20, 21. ‘ Is it so 3⁹ (think they with them·
selves) ‘ Does the first entrance of the land of promise, pro-
mise no better? There is little hope of the land itself, if
the beginnings of it are such. It is convenient, therefore,
that we send before us spies, who may bring us word, whe-
ther it is of so great account, that we should tire and hazard
ourselves by going to that soil, whose first appearance is so'
horrid and desperate.²—-And hence was that unhappy argu-
ment before their eyes, by the inducement of which the
whole multitude, by so unanimous a vote, concluded and
resolved against the land. And since now, after so much
time passed, they are come back to the same place, they
think, distrust, and complain of the same things.
