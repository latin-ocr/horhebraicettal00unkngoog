mow his land according to his own will, but according to the
rule of tradition.

‘⁶ The ⁸ inhabitants of Beth-Namer measured out a corner
for the poor with a line, and they gave a corner out of every
row. Abba Saul saith, They make mention of them to their
praise‚ and to their dispraise: to their dispraise‚ because
they gave one part out of a hundred; to their pmice, because,
measuring with a line, they collected and gave a corner out
of every row :” that is, meeting with a meoeuring line, they

out of every row of sheaves.

Tuus having taken some notice of the superficies of the
land, let us a little search into its bowels. You may divide
the subterraneous country into three parts: the metal mines,
the caves, and the places of burial.

This land was eminently noted for metal mines, so that

μετάλλοις τοὺς πάντας παραδίδωσιν· “ Then ¹¹ passing ιο tho
other confessore of Christ, he condemns them all to the brass
mines, which were in Pheno of Palestine.”

On the north part of the land, in the country of Asher‚
were mines of metal. Hence is that in Deut. xxxiii. 2 5,
“ Thy shoes shall be iron and brass.” On the south, in the
desert of Sin, the utmost bounds of J udea, were mines also:
