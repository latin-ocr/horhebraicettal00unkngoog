ekilful than a diver, to fetch this secret from the bottom.
‘ Jordan is not Jordan above J ericho,’ is a paradox that
vexes the Gloseere themselves, much more therefore may
it me. One understands the thing according to the bare
letter; for “ he that voweth (saith he) that he will not
drink of Jordan, may drink above J ericho.” Another under-
stands it of J ericho, as being a bonade, yea, as the bounds
named below J ericho only3 J osh. xviii. 20. We make no
tarrying upon the business, But if Jordan had euch a limita-
tion, that Jordan was not aboveP J ericho, ἦ περίχωρος Ἰορ-

flows out of the sea of Sodom into the Mediterranean. The
river Shihor, carrying blachum in its name, mayq be taken
for it, if it be any other; but neither does this appear con-
cerning it.

While you see multitudes gathered together to John, and
gladly baptized in Jordan, without fear, without danger,
alae, how much was Jordan changed from that Jordan in
that story of Saligniac! ‘⁸ Jordan (saith her), in which place
christ was baptized, is famous for a ruinous building. Here,
therefore, all we pilgrims went into the holy river, and washed
our bodies and our eouls 3 those from filth, and these from

happy accident disturbed our joys. For a certain phyeieian,
