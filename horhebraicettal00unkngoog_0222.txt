ΙΙ. The word *Tm “ the wilderneoe,'' denotes a champaign

count-ry, where one man’s ground is not distinguished from
another's by fenoes.

“ Theye do not breed up smaller cattle in the land of
lsrael, but in Syria they do. '‘w''sae ‘vm man-mm And cn
tho wildmesses qs tlte land qs Israel f.'' Where the Gloss
thus: ⁸⁴ They do not breed such cattle in the land of Israel,
that they seed not down the fields: now the fields in the land
of Israel do belong, without doubt, to some Israelite.” But
they fed in the deserts; that is, where field was not distin-
guished from field, but all was eommon. Henee you may
understand what is signified by the desert of Ziph, of Maon,
of Tekoah‚ ἅπας namely, a region or country neor to cities,
where also were scattered houses3 but especially, either
champaiyn, where no fences were to make distinction of
lands3 or mountainous, and that which was barren and with·
out improvement.

111. There is no need to speak of the deserte that were

altogether desolate and without inhabitant3 such as the
deserte of Arabia, of Libya, διο.

Snc‘r. IL—-l'l'l‘h‘l' *mm The wilderness ffJudaJa.

Panum Ι shall be laughed at if Ι distinguish between
the wilderness of J udah and the wilderness of J udea. And
formerly such a distinction did deserve laughter3 but when
the name of Idumen, as Ι have shewed, swallowed up a great
part of J udea, then it was not only to be borne with, but

necessary als0, to distinguish between the wilderness of J udah,
of which J osh. xv. 61, and the title of Psal. lxiii, aud the wil-
derness of J udea where John baptized.

The title of that Psalm iu the original Hebrew is thus,
πῃπῇ azyma wrm-2, πήχεις) *enm “ Α Psalm of David
when he wssss in the desert of Judah.³’ But the Greek inter-
preters render it, “A Psalm of David when he was ἐν τῇ
ἐρήμῳ τῆς Ἰδουμαίας, in tho wilderness qs Idumea.” And the
Vulgar, ‘⁶ A Psalm of David when he was in the desert of
Iduniea :'’ acting the part of no good interpreters, but of no
ill pan-aphraate. So Jer ix. 263 05523 372] rrpw ‘712 Ἐπὶ
Ἰδουμαίαν, καὶ ἐπὶ Ἐδῶμ· “ Upon Idumen, and upon'Edom.”
