The hell Mizaar. 349

agree more with 0¹7 hemana-1 5⁸50 ῙἿὉἾἾ '²9‘ ‘The waters
of Dimon are fun of blood?

Whilst we are in this watery country, are we ‘not got
amongst the rivers of Arnon? The learned Beza commenting
upon those words of St. John iii. 23, ὅτι ὕδατα πολλὰ ἦν ἐκεῖ,
“ for there was much water there‚'' affirmo it, commenting
thus: “ Multi videlicet rivi, quorum etiam in eo tractu circa

' Aroer fit mentio in libris Mosis;’' “ namely, many rivers, of

which also in that tract about Aroer there is mention in the
books of Moses.'' And the situation of the place confirms it3
when as Machaerus was the very utmost bounds of the ⁸ land
of Israel ’ towards Moab, according to Josephus, as also was
Arnon according to Moses.

But here we find no place that is called either Adrum or
salim. True‚ indeed; but the place, for the very wateriness
of it, deserves to be called AEmn, that is, a place ‘ff
sprinys ,· and if Salim may be the same with salaman,
here wc have also the Kenite or Salamwn, Gen. xv. [19.] and
Numb. xxiv. [22.] However, in a thing so very obscure, it is
safest not to be positive; and the reader’s candour is begged
in this modest way of conjecturing. The way we tread is
unbeaten‚ and deserves a guide‚ which as yet we have not
obtained.

Lm· us now (however something beyond our bounds) pass
from the first entering of the coasts of Moab towards the
north, to the utmost limits of it southward.

“Ι will remember thee (saith the Psalmist) from the laud

of Jordan, and of the Hermonites, *3⁷30 ἿἾὉ from the hill
Mizar. ” Where is this hill Mizar? not to take any
notice of what we meet with 1n Borchard and others, con-
cerning Hermon near Thabor (by what authority I cannot

tell), as also that ‘Nym ἾΤῘ the hill Mizaar, is rendered

almost by all, a little hill ‚- or, in a word, that the Targumist

and R. Solomon tell us, it is mount Sinai; Apollinea-ius,

that it is mount Hermon: it seems plainly to be the ‘ hilly

part of Zoar‚' whit-her Lot would have fied, is the straitness

of time might have permitted him, Gen. xix. 203 “ Oq let me
