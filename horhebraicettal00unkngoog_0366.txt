names, which, as they are there rendered, are still more per-
plexed and unknown. Consult the names used there for the
riversg of Eden, and the countries which those rivers ran
into, and you will see how difficult it is any where else to
meet with the least sootstep or track of those names, except
Cophin only, which seems indeed to agree something with
Cophen mentioned by Pliny ¹¹.

11. Places of themselves pretty well known are there called
by names absolutely unknown. Such are imm Gkatsplm,
for Assyria, Gen. ii. 14: 37³7*ss Lilak, for Babel, Gen. x. 9:
HND‘W) Salmaah for Euphrates, Gen. xv. 18: ΡἿΒ) Naplaik
for Egypt, Gen. xxvi. α.

ΙΙΙ. Sometimes ,there are names of a later date used. and
such as were most familiarly known in those days. Such
are mvl: Banias for Dan, Gen. xiv. 14, that is, Panias‚ the
spring of Jordan: 502³) Gennesar for Chinnereth‚ Numb.
xxxiv. 1 ι, Dent. iii. 17: not to mention Bathnan and Apamia
for Bashan and Shepham, which are so near akin with the
Syriac pronunciation ε and Gebalah‚ or Gablah, for Seir, ac-
cording to the Arabio idiom.

Such names as these make me suspect the Samaritan ver-
sion not to be of that antiquity which some would claim for
it, making it almost as ancient as the days of Ezra.

IV. 1 suspect too, when we meet with places pretty well
known of themselves, obsoni-ed by names most unknown, that,
sometimes, the whole country is not to be understood, but
some particular place of that country only.

The suspicion is grounded on the word Naphik for Eyypt,
and Sahnaalz for Euphrates. By Napkik‚ probably, they un-
derstood, not the whole land of Egypt, but Pelusium only,
which is the very first entry into Egypt from canaan. The
reason of this conjecture is this: the word 3702& Anpak (as
we have elsewhere observed) was writ over the gates of that
city3 and how near that word comes to Napln‘k, is obvious
enough to any one.

lt is possible, also, that the mention of the Kae'nites, imme·
diatcly following, might bring Salmaah to mind3 and so they
might not call ‘ Euphrates' itself ⁴ Salmaah‚’ but speaking of
