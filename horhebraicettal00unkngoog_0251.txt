Schema os the sea os Gennesaret. 241

eadm-as was distant sixty furlongs from Tiberias.

“ Bethsaida ὴ was in τῇ κάτω Γαυλανιτικῇ, lower Gaulanitz's‚”
beyond Jordan in Batanea. It is shown to pilgrims on the
shore of the sea of Gennesaret in Galilee3 and thence the
error os the maps was taken. Hear our countryman Bid-
dulph ³, who saw those places about the year 1600:

‘⁶ March the twenty-fourth, we rode by the sea of Galilee‚
which hath two names, John vi. ι, ⁴ The sea of Galilee‚' and
‘ Tiberias of Galilee,' because it is in Galilee3 and ‘ of Tibe-
rias? because the city of Tiberias was built near it: also
Bethsaida, another ancient city. We saw some ruins os t-he
walls of both. But it is said in that chapter, John vi. ι,
that J esus sailed over the sea of Galilee. And elsewhere,
that he went over the lake; and Luke ix. ιο, it is said that
he departed into a desert place near the city Bethsaida.
Which text of John I learned better to understand by seeing‚
than ever I could by reading. For when Tiberias and Beth-
saida were both on the same shore of the sea, and Christ
went from Tiberias tc, οι· near, Bethsaida 3 hence Ῑ gather,
that our Saviour Christ sailed not over the length or breadth
os the sea, but that he passed some bay, as much as Tiberias
was distant from Bethsaida. Which is proved thence, in that
it is said elsewhere, That a great multitude followed him thi-
ther οι] soot; which they could not do if hc had sailed over
the whole sea, to that shore among the Gergasenes which is
without the holy land.” These are his words.

But take heed‚ sir, that your guides, who show those places
under those names, do not impose upon you. lf you will
take J osephus for a guide, he will teach, that ‘⁶ Philipk re·-
paired the town Bethsaida; and he called it Julias, from
J ulias the daughter of Caesar :⁹⁹ and, that ‘⁶ that¹ J ulias was ἑν

τῇ κάτω Γαυλανιτικῇ, in lower Gauloniti&” Nor is tho argu· 0

ment good, ‘⁶ otherwise they would not follow him a-i'oot ;'’
for, from capernaum aud Tiberias, there was a very beaten

and common way by the bridge of Chammath into the coun-
try of the Gadarenes, and so to Bethsaida.
