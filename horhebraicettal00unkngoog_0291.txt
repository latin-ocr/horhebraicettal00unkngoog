“ Arki is Arcas of Libanus.’' Pliny writes thust; “ Paneas,
in which is Oaesarea with the spring before spoken, Abila,
Arca,”. &a Borchard thus, “ In terminos [read inter] Libani
et Antilibani offendimus castrum Arachas‚” &a “ On [or
rather between] the borders of Libanus and Antilibanus, we
found the strong-hold Arachas, and built by Aracheus the
son of Canaan, when the deluge was over.''

You see the Antiochian and Syrophoenician Syria pos-
sessed by the Oanaanites; and yet we are not come as far as
the land os Canaan.

Let us therefore proceed onwards with Canaan and the
rest of his sons. The borders of the Ganaanites, saith the
Holy Scriptum, ‘⁴ were from Sidon to Gerar, even unto Gaza,”
Gen. x. 19. You will say they were from Antioch, and
utmost Phoenicia‚ and a great part of Syria. True‚ indeed,
those countries‚ as we have seen, were planted by the sons of
Ganaan, but the Scripture doth not call them Oanaanites;
but where their coasts end towards the south, there the
Ganaanites’ begin. The tract therefore, or region first pos·-
sessed by them, is called by a peculiar name Canama, as dis-
tinct from the rest of the land of Canaan, J udg. iv. 23 where
‘⁴ J abin the king of Hazor” is called “ the king os Oanaan,''
that is, of the northern coast of the land of Ganaan. And
among the seven natione devoted by God himself to a curse
and cutting-off, the Ganaanites are always numbered, when
all indeed were Oanaanites: and that, as it seems, upon a
double reason3 partly, because that country was distinctly
so called, as another country, and was of a peculiar differ-
