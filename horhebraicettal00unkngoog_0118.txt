The princi pal cause of the destruction of Beth-Tera was
Ben-Oozba, and his rebellion against the Romans. The
Babylonian writers assign another cause.

ἾΠἿΞ ΞἾἾΠ ΡΞΟἾἺ Nm& ¹¹ “ For the foot of a chariot‚ was
Bathara laid waste. lt was a custom, that when an infant
male was born, they planted a cedar 3 when an infant female,
a pine; and, when the children, conti-acted marriage, out of
those trees they made the bride-chamber. On a certain day
the daughter of the emperor passed by, and the foot of her
chariot broke. They cut down such a cedar, and brought it
to her. [The Jews] rose up against them, and beat them.
It was told the emperor that the Jews rebelled. Being
angry‚ he marched against them, and destroyed the whole
horn of Israel,” Sic.

“ Hadrian¹ besieged Bethor three years and a half.—
And y when they took it, they slew the men, the women, and
the children, so that their blood flowed into the great sea.
You will say, perhaps, that it was near the sea; but it was
a mile distant. The tradition is, that R. Eliezer the Great
saith, That there were two rivers in the valley of J adaim, of
which one flowed this way,—the other, that. And the Rab-
bins computed that the third part of them was blood, and
two parts water. It was delivered also, that the heathen
gathered the vintages, for the space of seven years, without
dunging the land, because the vineyards were made fruitful
enough by the blood of the Israelites.''

The Jerusalem writers do hyperbolize enough concerning
the distance of this city from the sea. “ For if you say (say
they) that it was near the sea, was it not distant forty miles?
They say, that three hundred skulls of young children were
found upon one stone: and that there were three chests of
torn phylacteries, each chest containing nine bushels: but
there are others that say, nine chests‚ each containing three
bushels.’'
