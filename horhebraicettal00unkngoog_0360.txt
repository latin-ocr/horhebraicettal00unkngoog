escape to this oity; ΝῚΠ Ἶξῒζῐῦ &³:1¹1 is it not Μίεαν, or a
little om?'’ so that '5323sp ἾΠ, the hill Mizar may be the

same, as if it had been said ‘Nym 5³39 ἾΠ che luilly part qs the
little city Zoar.

The reasons of the conjecture. besides the agreeableness of
the name, may be especially these two :

l. As Hermonium, or Hermon, was· near the springs of
Jordan, so the hilly part of Zoar lay hard by the extreme
parts of Jordan in Asphaltites 3 and the Psalmist‚ speaking
of the land of Jordan, or of the land on the other side of
Jordan, seems to measure out all Jordan from one end to the
other, from the very spring-head to the furthermost part
where the stream ends.

ΙΙ. As David betook himself to the country on the other
side of Jordan towards Hermon, in his flight from his son
Absalom, so was it with him, when flying from Saul he
betook himself to Zoar in the land of Moab, 1 Sam. xxii. 3.
And so bewails his deplorable condition so much the more
bitterly, that both those times he was banished to the very
utmost munti-ies, north and south, that the river Jordan
washed.

Wrrn the mention of Zoar is this olause subjoined in
lsaiah, πρώην· ι-ιξξῳ Eylatla saeuam, or «τ a πωπω of
three years old.” So with the mention of Zoar and Horo-
naim, the same olause is also subjoined in J eremiah.

Isa. xv. 5: Πζιύπέαρ nbgsg *yfir-7:2⁶ we «ι His fugitives

Vulgar; “ Vestes ejus usque ad Segor: vitulam conter—
nantem.’' “Its bars were unto Segor: a heiser in his third
year.”
