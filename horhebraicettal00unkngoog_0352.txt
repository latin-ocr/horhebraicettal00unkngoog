Sscr. L—Oertain names and places os near sound
with Σαλεὶμ, ⁴ Salim.'

Lnr us begin with Σαλεὶμ, Sabim, and thence look aster its
neighbour ‘AEnon.’ We may be a little helped in our inquiry
by that passage in Genesis xxxiii. 18: ἾἾῙ 0¹21? 2329} 8522]
ῠξῐῂ “ And came to Shalem‚ a city os Sychem.'' There are
some versione, and the authors of the tables, have upon these
words built I know not what city Salem near Sychem. But
neither the Jews nor Samaritans acknowledge any such thing.
For the Jews render it, and that not without reason, “ And
Jacob came safe into the cit-y os Shechem.” The ⁸ Samaritan
text hath mbv, instead of 0512) “ he came in peaoo:” and
certainly there is no part of mankind could be more likely to
judge than the Samaritans, whether obv, in that place, were
the name of any city, yea or no.

II. Σαλεὶμ, Salim, in the Greek interpreter, according to the
Roman copy is the name of a place, J osh. xix. 22 ; where the
Hebrew runs thus, QZ? Πᾬῇἱ NP'QUQ] 5520} ‘7³:133 922³
“ And the coast [of Issaolzar] reacheth to Tabor, and Shaha-
zimah, and Beth-shemesh.” But the Greek, Καὶ συνάψει τὰ
ὅρια ἐπὶ Γαιθβὼρ, καὶ ἐπὶ Σαλὶμ κατὰ θάλασσαν, καὶ Baioca-
μῶς· “And the confines touched upon Gethbor‚ and upon
Salim near the sea, and Bethsamosh.’'

The Masorets observo that Shahazimah‚ which is written
with a Vau [Ἰ], should be written by- a Jod [³]; which also
these interpreters acknowledge (which is worthy our taking
notice of); but then they divide the word into two parts, and
write ihu-m* ΥΠΦ ἰ. e. Shukaz‚ κατὰ θάλασσαν, δἸιαΙιαΖ at tho
ssa.- but why they should turn Shahaz into Salim, it is some-
thing difficult to guess.

It seems probable that Σελάμη, Solam, which Josephus υ,
in the account of his own life, makes mention of, as fortified
by himself, amongst other towns in Galilec, is the same with
this Σαλὶμ, Sabim, mentioned by the Seventy; and that the
rather, because there it is reckoned up with mount Tabor.

111. Σααλεὶμ, Saalim, in the Alexandrian copy, answers to

t OnkeloS‚ Jonathan, Bereshith Babba, sect. 79. Schab. fol. 33, 2, διε.
