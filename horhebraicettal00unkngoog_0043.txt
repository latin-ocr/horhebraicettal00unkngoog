Ascalon. Gerar. 33

new· For thus he writes: ‘⁶ Thence'' (from Azotus) “is new
Ascalon distant two parsae, or leagues'' (that is, eight miles) ;
“ which Ezra, the priest‚ of blessed mernory‚ built at the sea-
shore :' and they called it, first, ΠὋἾἎε now that is distant
from old Ascalon, now destroyed, four leagues.''

So that, from Azotus to Ascalon, of which we are speaking,
and of which alone the Holy Scripture speaks, were, by his
computation‚ four-and-twenty miles ς and by the computation
of Adrichomius‚ two hundred furlongs, that is, five-and·twenty
miles.

‘⁶ Ten miles from Gaza” (says our countryman Sandes [San-
dys] ⁰, an eyewitness), “and near the sea, is placed Ascalon, now
of no note, anciently a venerable place to the heathen for the
temple of Dagon, and the festivals of Semiramis’s birthday.”

From Gaza to Azotus, Diodorus Siculus ‘¹ being witness,
are two-hundred and seventy furlongs: which amount ιο four-
and-thirty miles: namely, from Gaza to Ascalon, ten miles,
and thence to Azotus four-and-twenty.

That is a common saying‚ mv& DSWND, διο. “ From θ
Ascalon onward to the south, is the heat-hen country, and
Ascalon itself is reputed for a heathen country.” And yet
something of Ascalon was within the land of Israel. &³³22
phoca-1 The appa-ymera or oronam, did bound the
land of Ascalon on that coast, which we have observed be-
fore. And yet, ‘⁴ whenr R. Ismael Ben R. Josi, and Ben
Hakkaphar‚ were set over pbptw ἾἾἸΝ ¹735 the space of
Ascalon ’' (that is, when it was intrusted to them to judgc
concerning the spaces or parts of Ascalon,—namely, what
were within the land, and what without, aa.) “ they pro-
nounced it clean from the authority of R. Phinchasi Ben J air,
who said, We went down to the corn-market of Ascalon, and
thence we received wheat, and going up into our city we
washed, and ate our Thruma ;” i. e. The portion of first—fruits
belonging to the priests. The greatest part of the city, if
not the whole, was esteemed‚ under the second Temple, to be
‘without the limits of the land: but some part, or at least the
applffyards, and the places next adjacent, were within the land.
