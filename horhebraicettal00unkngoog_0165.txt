eludes, and saith, “ It is like to Beth-Mein, by which you
go down from Paltathah ; but by which you go up from Ti-
berias.’'

In J osephush, Βηθμαοῦς ἀπέχουσα Τιβεριάδος στάδια τέσσαρα 3
‘⁴ Beth-Maus [Beth-Meon] is distant from Tiberias four fur-
longs.” The maps place it too remote from thence.

II. There was also a place not far from Tiberias, or Mag-
dala, whose name was &Wo’r'l Ἶῦῧ Caphar Chinaia .· which
we may guess at, from this story :—“ R. Simeoni Bon La-
chish said thus, They whip a prince, that offends, in the
sessione of the three men. R. J udah Nasi hearing these
words was angry, and sent to apprehend him. But he fied
without Magdala: but some say, without Caphar Chittaia.”

ΤΙιο country of Gennesaret.

J osnrnus thus describes it ε “ Bym the lake Gennesar, is a
country extended, of the same name. of a wonderful nature
and pleasantness. For such is the fruitfulness of it, that it
denies no plant,'' &a “ The temper of the air suits itself with
different fruits: so that here grow nubs, a more winter fruit3
there palms, which are nourished with heat 3 and near them
figs and olives, which require a more moderasse air,'’ Suc.

The Talmudists speak like things of the fertility and plea-
sure of this place.

‘⁶ The¹1 Rabbins say, Why is it called Gennesar? Because of
the gai-dens os princes (0³50 ³22). Those are the great men
who have gardens in that place. And it was of the lot of
Nephthali” (they are the words of the author of Aruch)‚ “ as
it is said, ‘ And a thousand princes were of N ephthali! '⁹

The fruita of Gennesaret are mentioned as being of great
fame. ‘⁶ WhereI'ore (say they0) are there not of the fruits of
Gennesaress at J emsalem3 The reason is, that they who came
to the feasts should not say, We had not come but to eat the
fruits of Gennesaret.”
