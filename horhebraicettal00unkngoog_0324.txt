πηγὴ γραμμάτων, a fountain qf letters, J osh. xxi. 29, let those
that are more learned, search out. It is true, the children
of Issachar are celebrated for their skill in computing the
times, 1 Chron. xii. 323 where the Targumist, “ They were
skilled in calculating the beginnings of the years, the calends
of the months, and the intercalation both of years and months;

If we would include the Levites, that dwelt amongst the
tribe of Issachar, under the general name of Issachar‚ then
might Engannim, being a Levitioal cit-y, be an academy for
that kind of mathematica] learning; but in both we are very
uncertain. Nor is it less obscure, that the same Greek in·
terpreter hath, instead of Remeth, Engannim (1, Enhaddah, ’
and Bethpazes, rendered, Ῥεμμᾶς, καὶ 'leam καὶ Τομμᾶν, καὶ

Emmaus, Luke xxiv.

I. Several thiuys about its name and place. II. Its situation.

111. Some story qf it. Also of Timn-ath. and mount Gilead,

J udg. vii. 3.

Snc‘r. 1.-Severaz thinys about its name and place.

Ws have spoken something already concerning Emmaus
in our Chorogmphical Centum, ehap. xlv3 let us add some
few things in this place.

I. It was distant from Jerusalem, as appears both from
our evangelist and J osephus ¹, about threescore furlongs.
By account of common furlongs‚ seven miles and a half,
eight of the J ewish. What copy, therefore, of J osephus must
the learned Beza have by him, who thus speaks upon the
place? Ἑξήκοντα, “ sixty3 so the Syriae hath it, and indeed
all copies : so that here is either a mistake in the number, or
else it is ill written in Josephus, thirty furlongs.'' Our Jo-
sephus plainly hath it, χῶριον ὃ καλεῖται μὲν Ἀμμαοῦς ἀπέχει
δὲ τῶν Ἱεροσολύμων σταδίους ἑξήκοντα· “ A town called Em·
maus, distant from Jerusalem threescore furlongs.''
