Saith he, I will twice utter my voice, and Ι will bring in eighty
youths handsomely habited, themselves merry, and shall make
you so. They say to him, Such we would have. He utters
his voice the first time, and the young men put on their clean
clothes '³ (free from the raim, for they had carried them with
them covered and safe in certain vessels for the same purpose).
“Crying out the second time, in they all comet and a sign
