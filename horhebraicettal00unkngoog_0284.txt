Gloss thus : “ In Rekam were Israelites ; and yet spots
coming from Rekam are clean, because they belong to Israel-
ites‚ and the Israeliten hide their spots,'’ διο.

Gades, as Bridenbaehius relateS‚ is called Oawatha by the
Arabians: for thus he writes3 “ At length we came into a eer-
tain country, which, in the Arabian tongue, is called Cawatha‚
but in the Latin* Cades.” Which while we read, those things
oome into my mind which the eminent Edward Pooook‚ a
man of admirable learning, discourseth coneerning the word
Kawa [4593] in his very learned Miscellaneam Notoe⁵‚ that it
should signify oryinq ahud, cm owtory, Sto. To whioh whether

that denotes bellowiny, may any way answer, it is more fit for
that great oraele of tongues to judge than for so mean a man

the days of J oshua; but fired in the war of Gibeah: because
it is said, “All the eities also, to whioh they came, they set
on fire,” J udg. xx. 483 but that it was rebuilt by Elpaal, a
Benjamite‚ thron. viii. 12 3 “ R. Lazar Ben R. Josah saith, ’
It was destroyed in the days of the eonoubine in Gibeah3 but
Elpaal stood forth and repaired it.”

With Lod and Ono is also joined 0³2⁷?OE 24³3 or, “ The
valley of orastsmen,” Neh. xi. 3 53 which some of the Jews
suppose to be a particular oity3 and that it was walled from
the days of J oshua. ‘⁶ But saith R. Chananiah‚ in the name of
