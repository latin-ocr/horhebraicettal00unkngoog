Psephin tower, of which J osephus Υ thus; Θαυμασιῶτερος ἀνεῖχε
κατὰ γωνίαν βόρειός τε καὶ πρὸς δύσιν ὁ Ψήφινος, &Q “ On the
north-west corner, the admired Psephin tower lists up itself‚
near which Titus encamped,'' Sne.

There was no gate on this north side. The buildings,
which were inward‚ are mentioned, Neh. iii. 20—24 3 and
the Hippic tower is mentioned by J osephus.

On the east· were, 1. A tower‚ advancing itself in the very
bending of the north-east corner. Within was the ‘ King's
House,' and the court of the prison, ver. 25. 2. The Water-
gate, of which is mention, Neh. xii. 37. 3. ophel, and the
Home-gete, Neh. iii. 27, 28 ; of which mention is also made,
J er. xxxi. 40. Whence was the beginning of the valley of
Ben-Hinnom: which, running out below the city southward,
at last bent into the west. Therefore, the Water-gate led
into the valley of Kedron: but the Home-gnte into the
valley of Hinnom‚ at that place touching on the valley of
Kedron. 4. The Gate Miphkad: the Vulgar calls it, The
Gate of J udgment. 5. Not far distant thence was the south-
cast corner. And thence a little on the south side was the
Sheep-gate‚ whence we first set out.

Let us add the words of J osephus, describing how the
outmost wall went. Ἀρχομένονὶι δὲ κατὰ βορρᾶν, &Q ‘⁸ It
began on the north at the Hippic (or horse) tower‚ and ex-
tended to the Xystus (or open galla-y),- then touching upon
the Oouncil·house‚ it ended at the east walk of the Temple.
On the other side, westwardly, beginning from the same
tower, it strctched along by a place called Bethso, to the
gate of the Essenes3 and thence it inclined to the south be-
hind the fountain Siloam: and hence it bowed again east-
wardly uuto Solomon's pool, and passed on to a certain place,

effipaessich words let us observe two things for the asserting

the procession that we have gone 2—1. That this description
proceeds from the north to the west, the south, and the east.

2. That Ophla, or ophel, lay between the south-east corner
and the porch of the Temple; which cannot at all be con-
