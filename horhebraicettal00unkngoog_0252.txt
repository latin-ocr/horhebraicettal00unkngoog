Cana was a great way distant from Tiberias: J osephus ¹¹²
spent a whole night travelling from this town ιο that with
his army. It was situate against J ulias of Bethammphtha, as
may be gathered from the same author in the place quoted ὓ
in the margin. Now that J ulias was situate at the very influx
of Jordan into the sea of Gennesaret.

These things might be more largely explained and illus-
trated, but we are afraid os being too long; and so much the
more, because we have treated copiously of them elsewhere.
This will be enough to an unbiassed reader, to whose judg-
ment we leave it; and now go on ιο Dalmanutha.

Ir we may play a little with the name Dalmanutha, hear

a Talmudioal tradition. “ He⁰ that sells a farm ιο his neigh-
’ bour, or that receives a lace from his neighbour‚ 5¹7 nimy&
amb mamb& nm m mann m: to make kim a hom os
betrotkinq for his son, or a house os widowlwod for lais dauylatem
let him build it four cubits this way, and six that.” Where the
Gloss, ’1Πέζῖ mamb& D'Z “ A house qs widowlaood sor lais
dauykter, whose husband is dead, and she now returns to the
house of her father.”

The meaning of this tradition is, ‘ When the son of any
one had married a wife, he did not use to dwell with his fa-
ther-in-law; but it was more customary for his father to
build him a litt-le house near his own house.' So also when
the husband was dead, and the daughter, now being a widow,
returned to her father, it was also customary for the father
to build her a little house ; in which she dwelt, indeed, alone,
but very near her father.

ButP now from some such house of more note than ordi-
nary, built for some eminent widow; or from many such
houses standing thick together, this place, perhaps. might
be oaued anxiabat-1 Dalmanucha, that is, τι The place of
widowhood.” And if some more probable derivation of the

name occurred not, it might, not without reason, have had
respect to this.
