The pool of Siloam. 363

loam, was Gihon, 1 Kings i. 33; ‘⁶ Bring ye him [Solomon]
down to (3111011.υ Targum, to ‘ Siloam ε’ Κ11110111 5, “ Gihon
is Siloam, and is ealled by a twofold name.'’ The tables
that describe Jerusalem speak of a * mount Gihon ς’ by what
warrant Ι cannot tell ε if they had said the ‘somatain Gihon,'
it might have blensed better.

ΙΙ. How that name ‘ Gihon’ should pass into * Siloam,’ is
diffieult to say. ‘⁴ The waters'' of it are mentioned, Isa. viii. 6,
to signify the reign and sovereignty of the house of David.
So the Targum and Sanhedrinss. ** Rabh J oseph saith, If there
had been no Tar-gum os this Scriptum, we had not known
the sense of it, which is this: Forsomueh as this people is
weary of the house of David, whose reign hath been gentle
as the flowing of the waters of Siloam, whieh are gentle,'' 810.
Therefore it was not in vain that David sent his 8011 Solomon
to be anointed at Gihon or Siloam, for he might look upon

those waters as some type or shadow by which the reign of
his house should be deeiphered.

III. The situation of it was behind the west wall, not far
from the eorner that pointed towards the south-west. Ἔπειτα
πρὸς vti τὸν ὑπὲρ τὴν Σιλωὰμ ἐπιστρέφον πήγηι·, ἔνθεν τε πάλιν
ἐκκλίνον πρὸς ἀνατολήν· “Thea wall beut southward above
the fountain of Siloam, and then again inclined towards the
east.’' ,

The waters of this spring, by different streame, derived
themselves into two fish-pools, as seems hinted in 2 Chron.
xxxii. 30: “ Hezekiah stopped the upper water-course of
Gihon, and brought it straight down to the west side of the
city of David;” where a MS of the Targum‚ ΠἸἎΡΞὮ n'· ‚7175
prm ἣτ). instead of Ὴτ) we should write ’ἠΰ qs tho 1001918.-
{emuna prm* ³73me I suspect that for Γ3ῚἾΕ13, should

written ΓΞῘἾὩΞ. in pipes: **Ηο stopped up the upper waters
of Gihon, and brought them 111 pipes.'’ But to let this pass,

that whieh I would observe is this. that there was a water·
course from Gihon or Siloam, which was called the ‘⁶ upper
water-course‚” which flowed into a pool, called also the “ upper
pool‚'' Isa. xxxvi. 2; and, as it should seem, the “ old pool‚'’
Isa. xxii. 11 3 by J osephus ‘⁸ the pool’' or “ fieb-pool of Solo-
mon ;'' for so he, in the plaee before oited.
