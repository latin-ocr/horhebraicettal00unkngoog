set up by Jacob for a witness of the covenant betwixt him
and Laban. (Gen. xxxi.)

We read-of something not unlike it set up by J oshua
near Shechem, in testimony of the covenant betwixt the
people and God, J osh. xxiv. 26. Now, therefore, who can
doubt but that J oshua was buried near Shechem3 For when
that place was particularly bequeathed and set out by Jacob
for his son J oseph, who, of the whole stock and lineage-of
J oseph, could justlier inherit that part of the country than
J oshua3

He was buried on the north side of the hill Gaash, in his
own ground. Might not that hill be also called Gilead,
upon the account of that pillar of witness that was built
there a little from Sychem? whence the foot of the hill, and
the hill itself beginning to rise (if it were northward, which
we suppose), then it might very well reach not sar from that
place where this matter of Gideon was transacted. For,
whereas the field wherein the battle was, was within the
tribe of Manasseh, contiguous to mount Ephraim, and Gi-
deon proelaims that whosoever were afraid should depart from
mount GileadÍ¾ we can, perhaps, think of no more proper
sense wherein this mount Gilead can be taken, than that
that part of mount Ephraim was so called from the pillar of
testimony placed on the south side of it, when the common
name for it was the hill Gaash.
