laid wait for him, but he was slaiu and buried at the moun-
tain of that name.”
Those words of Moses do rack interpretem, Exod. xvii. 16:

Πζηῦέ ‘732 '12 Jad Al Gan-jah. The Seventy render it,
Ἐν χειρὶ κρυφαίᾳ πολεμεῖ Κύριος, “ The Lord wars with a se·
cret⁴ hand.’' All other versione almost render it to this sense,
“ The haud upon the throne of the Lord.” So the Sama-
ritan, Syrian, Arabio, Vulgar, and the Rabbins,—- that is,
‘ God hath sworn.’

-What if Πζῦὲ Cas-jah be Oasiotisi For that country was
the country of the Edomites‚ but especially of the Ama-
lekites‚ concerning whom Moses treats in that history. We
will not too boldly depart from the common consent of all,
and we do modestly and humbly propound this conjecture:
which if it may take any place, the words may there be ren-
dered, without any scruple or knot‚ to this sense, ‘⁶ The hand
of the Lord is against Cassiotis,’' (the country of the Ama-
lekites; for) “ the Lord hath war with Amalek from genera·
tion to generation.''

Sacr. IV.—Rhinooorura. The Arabio Interpreter noted.

Wn are now come to the river Sichor3 called ‘ the river of
Egypt? not because it was within the Egyptian territories,
but because it was the J ews' limits towards Egypt. There,
heretofore‚ was ‘ Rhinocorura? Whenoe the Seventy‚ iu Isa.
xxvii. 12, render ῦξἾ-Ξζῷ Βζϊὲᾜ “ Unto the river of Egypt,”
Ἕως Ῥινοκορούρωυ, ‘3 Unto the Rhinocoruri.” Ι suppose
the Ambio interpreter imitated them, and writ first ἾἹἾὉ
Corma ,· but that at last a little point¹¹ crept in into the
last letter, and so it was changed from r into n. So that
now we read vnn, which is sounded Coronis, in the Latin
interpreter.
