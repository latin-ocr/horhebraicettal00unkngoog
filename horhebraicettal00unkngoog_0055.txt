Both-el. Beth-aven. 45

τὸ δὲ πλάτος, Ἱεροσολύμοις ὁριζομένην, ’καὶ Βεθήλοις· “ 'Phe
Benjamites' portion of land was from the river Jordan to the
sea, in length ε in breadth, it was bounded by Jerusalem and
Beth-el.'' Let these last words be marked, ‘⁶ The breadth of
the land of Benjamin was bounded by Jerusalem and
Beth-212⁹ May we not justly conclude, from these words,
that Jerusalem and Beth-el were opposite, as it were, in a
right line ¹? But if you look upon the maps, there are some
that separate these by a irery large tract of land, and make
them bend and slope from one another.

Beth-el heretofore was Luz: of which the Rabbins upon
J udg. i. 23, Sto. do not a little trifle. Sometimes it is called
Beth-aven. So the Talmudists; “ Thate town, which some-
times was called Beth-el, afterward was called Beth-aven.”
And the Chaldee upon Hos. iv. 15: ‘vt-inu& ῙἸΡΟΠ 24¹7
“ Go not up to Beck-213³ for the Hebrew, 1223 rw} ³³:213 ¹725
“Go not up to Beth-aven.” So also chap. x. 5, 8. Not that
there was not another town, named Beth-aven (see J osh.
xviii. 12, 13): but that Beth-el too deservedly bore the re-
proach of that name, in the same manner as Jerusalem bore
the name of Sodom‚ Isa. i. 10.

It is said of Deborah, that she lived “ between Ramah
and Beth-el in mount Ephraim,'’ Judg. iv. 5: where the
Targum thus3 “ She had gardens in Ramatha, olive-trees
making oil in the valley‚ a house of watering in Beth-213⁹
Not that Beth-el properly was in the hill-country of Ephraim,
since that town stood upon the very boundaries of J udea:
but that the dwelling of Deborah was at the beginning of
that hill-country, a valley running between that hill-country
and those boundaries. Beth-el itself was situate in a hilly
country, J osb. xvi. 1 ; which yet one would scarcely eall the
hill-country of Ephraim (since there was a time, when Beth-el
and her towns belonged to Judea, 2 Chron.xiii. 19: hence
the idolatry of those of Judah is sometimes mixed with the
Ephraimites’‚ of which they hear often enough from the pro-
phets) ς but it was a certain hilly place, running out between
Judea and the land of Ephraim: see J osh. xviii. 12.

On the east of Beth-el heretofore was Hai, Gen. xii. 8,

c Hieros. Shab. fol. 11. 4. et Avod. Zar. sol. 43. 3.
