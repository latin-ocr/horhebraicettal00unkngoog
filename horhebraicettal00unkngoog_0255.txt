A mast. 245

“ Ι am not sent but to the lost sheep of lsrael only ;'' and to
his disciploe, “ Go not into the way of the Gentiles ;'' and,
“ If these wonderful works had been done in Υ Tyre and
Sidon;''—you will never persuade me that he ever went as far
as the gates of Sidon.

ΙΙ. It is said by St. Mark, that aster that maid was
healed‚ Christ came “from the coast os Tyre and Sidon ιο
the sea of Galilee, through the middle of the coasts of De-
capolis.’' What! from the gate of Sidon to the sea of
Galiba, through the midst of Decapolisss It would have
been more properly said, “Through the midst of Galilee:”
and hence, as it seems, some have been moved to place
Decapolis within Galilee‚ with no reason at all. We shall
meet with it in another place, in the following chapter, and
in such a place, that it is not easy to conceive how Christ
could pass through it from the gate of Sidon to the sea of
Galilee.

Sssc'r. Ile-‘7522 Ὅριον· Α σοαπ.

To determine coneerning ὁρίοις Τύρου καὶ Σιδῶνος, “ the
· coasts of Tyre and Sidon,” in this story, we first propound
this to the reader: Ῑι is said, 1 Kings ix. ιι, 12, that
‘⁴ Solonion gave to Hiram, the king of the Tyrians, twenty
cities² in Galilee :'' which when he had seen and liked them

not, ·‘ he called the land ‘7523 Chabul unto this day.” The
LXX render it, ἐκάλεσεν αὐτὸς Ὅριον, “ he called them the
border or coast.’' Now let any one, I beseech you, skilled in
the tongues, tell me what kin there is between ‘7522 and
Ὅριον, α bound, or coast, that moved the LXX so to render
ita.

The Talmudists speak various things of the word 3752:
Chabul .· but the sense and signification of the word Ὅριον,
α coast, is very far distant from their meaning. The Jerusalem
Talmudistsb speak thus; ΠἸἿἚ rium> nrm> ΥἾΝ ‘7le
‘⁴ Chabul signifies a land which bears not fruit.” The Baby-
Ionianc thus; “What is the meaning of the land chabul?
