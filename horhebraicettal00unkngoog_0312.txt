itis, which we are now upon. Perhaps there might be some
part of Antilibanus called Hauran, either from the Syriae
word ἾἹἸΠ Havar, which signifies white3 or from the Hebrew
word ἾἹΠ Hor, a cave. It may well enough agree either way,
the hill being white with snow, and hollow with tlte subter-
roman passaque that were there.

However, it is plain enough, from the place in Ezekiel
before quoted, that Hauran was situated in the very extreme
parts of the land towards the north, and from thence the
country, as it had its situation there, so had its name Aura-

it near the sea of Gennesaret: “ Subito enim transcursa
regione Auranitide, quae secus mare Tiberiadis est,'’ διο.
“ The country of Auranitis being suddenly run through,
which is by the sea of Tiberias,” 8710.

And that the river Orontes [springing between Libanus
and Antilibanus near Heliopolis, as Plinyc hath it] took its
name from Hauran, the word itself seems to assure us. Al-

apprehend it to be a Latin name. Ἀλλοι δὲ φάσιν (saith he)
ὅτι Καῖσαρ Τιβέριος ἐκ Δράκοντος αὐτὸν Ὀρόντην μετωνόμασεν,
ὃ σημαίνει Ἀνατολικόν· As if ‘ Orontes' were the same with
‘ Orientalis,' ‘ the Eastern.’ But what that ἐκ Δράκοντος
should mean is a little difficult. Orontes was of old called

Typhon, as Strabod tells us.

Tun reader must excuse me if I make a narrower search
into the situation of Iturea, although Barradius may confi·
dently enough have told him (upon his own trust merely, as
sar as I can learn), that “the country is in the tribe of Neph-
thali, at the foot of mount Libanus.” Perhaps he hath fol-
lowed Borchard, who himself writes only upon the credit of
J acobus de Vitriaco: ‘⁶ Scias regionem Decapolin quam va·

region of Decapolis hath several names in Scripture. Some-
times it is called Iturea3 sometimes, Trachonitis; sometimes,
