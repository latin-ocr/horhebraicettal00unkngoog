gardens‚ and paradises, and vineyards, and olive-yards. And
two parsae thence (eight miles) is Neapolis, which is also Sy-
chem in mount Ephraim. And it is seated in a valley be·
tween the mountains Gerizim and Ebal: and in it are about
a hundred Outheans observing the law of Moses only, and
they are called Samaritans: and they have priests of the seed
of Aaron.'’ And a little after, ‘⁴ They sacrifice in the Temple
in mount Gerizim, on the day of the Passover, and the feast·

of those stones which the children of Israel set up when
they passed over Jordan‚” διο. And afterward‚ “ In mount
Gerizim are fountains and paradisos: but mount· Ebal is dry,
like the stones and rocks: and between them, in the valley,

You may not improperly divide the times of Samaria under
the second Temple into heathenism,—namely‚ before the
building of the Temple at Gerizim,- and after that into
Samaritanism, as it was distinguished from Judaism, and as
it was an apostasy from it: although both religione indeed
departed not a hair’s breadth from deceitful superstition.
