bul, because they displeased him, but restored them back ιο

Solomon in some indignation.

Kimchi on the place more rightly, “ Ιι is very well ex-
pounded, that Hiram gave cities to Solomon in his own
land3 and he placed Israeltes there to strengthen himself.
And he, in like manner, gave cities ιο Hiram in Galilee; and
that ιο strengthen the league between them. In the Book
of the Kings it is recorded what Solomon gave ιο Hiram;
and in this‚’' of the Chronicles‚ ‘⁶ what Hiram gave ιο Solo·
mon.” Most true indeed: for that Hiram gave ιο Solomon
some cities in his jurisdiction‚ appears beyond all contro·
versy from thence, that Solomon is said ιο build Tadmor
in the wilderness‚ 1 Kings ix. 18. But what is that place
Tadmorz J osephus will teach us: Θαδαμόρα ...... οἱ Ἕλληνες
προσαγορεύουσι Παλμυράν· “ Thadamor (saith he s), the Greeks
call Palmyra.” And the Vulgar interpretem read, “ He built
Palmyra.” Therefore we must by no means think that Hiram
rejected the cities that were given him by Solomon, however
they pleased him not; but kept them for his own, which
Solomon also did with them which Hiram gave ιο him.

Buta whence should the Greek interpretem render that
place called ³752: chabul by Ὅριον, a coast, when there is no
affinity at all between the significations os the words?

Tur. Greek interpretem are not seldom wont to render the
names of places, not by that name as they are called in the
Hebrew text, but as they are called in after-times under
the second Temple: which is also done often by the Ohaldee
Targumists. Of this sort are, Καππάδοκες, Cappadociam, for
Caphtorim ε ‘ Ρινοκόρουρα, Rhinocorura, sor ‘ the river of
Egypt ς’ os which we have spoken before: and among very
many examples which might be produced, let us compare one
place out of the Talmudists with them.
