Wmm we are speaking of Syrophoenieia, we are not far
off from a place where the sabbatio river either was, or was
seigned ιο be: and 1 hope the reader will pardon me, if 1
now wander a little out of my bounds, going ιο see a river
that kept the sabbath ε for who would not go out of his way
ιο see so astonishing a thing?

And yet, if we believe Pliny, we are not without our bounds‚
for he fixeth this river within J udea. “ In J udea (saith he⁰)
a river every sabbath day is dry.’'—-Josephus otherwise3
“ Titus (saith he Ρ, going to Antioeh) saw in the way a river
very well worthy to be taken notice of, between the eities of
Area and Raphana, eities of the kingdom oi' Agrippa. Now
it hath a peeuliar nature. For, when it is of that nature. that
it flows sreely‚ and does not sluggishly glide away; yet it.
wholly fails from its springs for six days, and the place of it
appears dry. And then, as if no change at all were made,
on the seventh day the like river ariseth. And it is by oer-
tain experienee found that it always keeps this order. Whenee
it is called the ‘ Sabbatie river) from the hely seventh day of
the Jews.”

Whether of the two do you believe, reader! Pliny saith,
That river is in Judea: Josephus saith, No. Pliny saith, It
is dry on sabbath days: J osephus saith, It flows then. The
Talmudists agree with Pliny; and J osephus agrees not with
his own eountrymen.
