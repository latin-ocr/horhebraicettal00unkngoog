The mountain of moto.

Τ1118 eoa-st is described by Moses, Num. xxxiv. 7 : “ From
the Great Sea to mount Hor: from mount Hor to the entrance
os Hamath,” 810.

Mount Hor, in the J ewish writers, ie Amanah3 mention of
whieh occure, Cant. iv. 8, where R. Solomon thus: ‘⁴ Amanah
is 8 mount in the northern coast of the land of Israel, whioh
in the Talmudioal language is ealled ῙὋῸᾺ Uim, The moun-
tainous place of Amanum the 881118 with mount Hor.”

In the Jerusalem Targum, for mount ‘ Hor' is mm D'twwo
tho mount Manus .· but the Targum of J onathan rendere it
Dum& D'rmto The mountain Umanis.

“ Whatf (say the Jerusalem writers) is of the land of
Israel, and what without the land? Whatsoever eomes down
from mount Amanah inwards ἰ8 of the land of Israel 3 what-
eoever is without the mountainous place of Amanah is with-
out the land.”

And 8 little after3 “R. Jueta. Bar Shunem said, When
the Israelitess that return” (from their &spei-sion), ‘⁶ shall
have arrived at the mountainous places of Α111811811, they shall
sing a song3 which is proved from that which ἰ8 said (Cant.
iv. 8), 0722?ss lv'&'l?3 ’Ἷῆζὺζῆ He rendere it, Thou ehalt sing
from the hedd of Amanah.''

There was 8180 8 river of the same name with the mouu-
tain, of whioh the Targum in that plaee; ‘⁶ Theyh that live
by the river Amanah, and they that live 011 the top of the
mountain of enow, shall offer thee 8 present.'' And the
Aruoh, whioh we have noted before, writes thus3 “ Kirmioni
ie a river in the way to 0811188088, and ie the 881110 with
Αω811811.”
