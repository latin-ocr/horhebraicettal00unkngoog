J osh. v, when this which Moses speaks of is really Galilee3
as I have proved elsewhere.

On these two mounts (it is well known) were pronounced
the blessings and the curses, Deut. xi. 29, and xxvii. 12, 13:
J osh. viii. 33. But mark the impudence of the Samaritana,
wh0, in their text, Dent. xxvii. 4, instead of “ Ye shall set

up these stenes which Ι command you this day ΒΨ WU? on
mount Ebal‚” they have put “Ye shall set up these stenes, Sco.
ΕἾἾἾἎ ’1Πὲ on mount Gerizim.'’

Compare, with this falsification of theim, that in Sotah k,
‘⁴ R. Eliezer Ben J ose saith, I have said to you, O Samaritans,
Ye have falsified your law; for ye say, 0227 ΠἿἹὩ ³:5³7& the
plain of Moreh, which is &hachem Deut. xi. 30 [they add She-
chem of their own] ε we ourselves indeed confess that the plain
of Moreh is Shechem,” 810.

Seeing he blames the Samaritans for falsifying their text
in so little a matter, wherein the truth is not injured‚ namely‚
in adding Shechem, why did he not object to them that
greaterl fault of suborning Gerizim for mount Ebal. The
truth is, this very thing giveth me reason enough to suspect
that this bold and wicked interpolation of the word G'on'zim
for Ebal hath stolen into the Samaritan text since the time

that this Rabbin wrote. The thing is not unworthy our con-
sidering.

sacr. IV.— Why it is written Sychem and not Sychem.

ir Sychem and Sychar be one and the same city, why
should not the name be the same?

Ι. This may happen from the common dialect, wherein it
is very usual to change the letters. So Reuben in the Syriae
version is Reubz‘l, and Ῥούβηλος, Butam, in J osephus ς by what
etymology let him tell, and explain it if you can. Speaking
of Leah bringing forth Reubeu‚ he thus expresseth himself ¹¹¹3
Kal γενομένου παιδὸς ἄρρενος, καὶ διὰ τοῦτο πρὸς αὐτὴν ἑπεστρεμ-
μένου τοῦ ἇνδρὸς, Ῥούβηλον ὀνομάζει τὸν υἱὸν, διότι κατ’ ἔλεον

having brought forth a male child, and obtaining favour from
her husband by it, she called his name Rubel‚ because it
