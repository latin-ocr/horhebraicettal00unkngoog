Wild honey. 21 ’7

always twelve thousand men in it, of the courses of the
priests. 3. That way was daily trodden by a very numerous
multitude, partly of such who travelled between those cities,
partly of such who went out of other parts of J udea, and
likewise out of the land of Ephraim into Perea, and of them
