Zalmon. 2443

But we suppose the name is derived elsewhere, namely,
from 3505! Ζαῦηιοπ, 3 (Tsade) being changed into Ἴ ([)aleth);
which is no strange thing to the Syrians and Arabiane.

Οἷς Zalmon we meet with mention, J udg. ix. 48 3—namely,
a mountain, or some tract in a mountain, near Sychem: but
that place is a very great way off of that concerning which
we are now treating. But the Tahnudistsr mention a place
called Zalmon, which agrees excellently well with Dalma-
nutha. ‘⁴ There is a story (say they) os a certain man in
Zalmon‚ who said, 1, N, the son of N, am bitten by a serpent,
and behold I die. They went away and found him not: they
went away, therefore, and married his wife.'' The Gloss is,
‘⁶ They heard the voice of him crying, and saying, Behold, I
die; but they found not such a man in Zalmon.” And
again³; “ There is a story in Zalmon, of a certain man who
planted his vineyard sixteen and sixteen cubitia and a gate
of two ranks of vines: now he turned on this side, and the
year following on the other, and ploughed on both sides.
And the cause was brought before the wise men, and they
approved of it.”

None will suspect this Zalmon to be the same with that
near Sychem, when it is said, that “ they brought the cause
before the wise men :” for what had the Samaritans to do
with the wise men of the J ewa? One might rather believe it
to be some place near to Tiberias (where was a university of
wise men), well known and commonly spoke of, and men-
tioned in the traditione cit-ed as a place so known. So divers
places about Tiberias are mentioned by the Talmudists as
well known, which you will scarce find any where but in the
books of the Talmudists. Such are Chammath, Magdala,
Bet-h Meon, Paltatbah, Caphar Chittaia, διο. Concerning
which we have spoken in another place. There was also
