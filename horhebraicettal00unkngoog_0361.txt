Jer. xlviii. 34: ΠξΨἿῖΡΨ ΓΊῖΞΖΨ ῦῖἒῆἦΠἽζ] ἾᾙἿΒᾯ “ from
Zoar to Horonaim, a heifer of three years old?

Vulgar3 ‘⁶ Α Segor usque ad Horonaim‚ vitula eonter-
nante :⁹⁹ “ From Segor unto Horonaim‚ the heifer being in
her third year.” And so others.

Ι am not ignorant what commentatore say upon these
plaees: but why may not 3215*le Πῖἳλξ Eylath Skolishzjah be
the name of some plaee‚ and so ealled a third Eylak, in
respeet of two other places mueh of the same sound; or
duchon, or noble qualc‚ as &¹¹³2ss signifies a duke or tri-
buno.

There is mention of 02³2& Γᾷ.) Eia Effzz’m, in that country,
Ezek. xlvii. ¹03 where Eylaim is plainly of the dual number,
and seems to intimate that there were two Eyels, with relation
to which this our Eylah may be ealled Eylalc the third. So·
Ramathaim, 1 Sam. i. 2, is of the dual number, and plainly
shews there were two Ramahs.

The sound of the word Neela eomes pretty near it. This
we meet with in Ptolemy‚ in Arabia Petraea:

Ζῶαρα, Zoar . 67. 20. 30. 30.
Θοάνα, Thoan . 67. 30. 30. 30.
Νέκλα, Neela . 67. 20. 30. ¹5·

So ¹ that here we see the geographer mentions Zoar and
Neela, as the prophet before had Zoar and Eglah: and how
easily might Eglah pass into Neela in Greek writing‚ espe-
eially if the letter y hath any thing of the sound of the letter
n in it. The geographer makes the distanee of Zoar from
Neela to be fifteen miles: so, we may suppose, was the dis-
tanee of Zoar from Eglah‚ Horonaim lying between them;
from whenee the words of the prophet may not be unfitly
rendered thus ε

“ His fugitives shall flee unto Zoar, unto the third Eglah.

From Zoar unto Horonaim: even unto the third Eglah.’'

Ι am deeeived ἰΓΆγαλλα, Amana, whieh we meet with in
«Iosephus ³, be not the Eglah we are now speaking of ε num-
bering up the twelve eities, whieh Hyreanus promised he
would restore to Aretas‚ the Arabian king, being what his
father Alexander had taken from him: amongst the rest he
