little, the whole land of Canaau within Jordan. Then they
spread themselves into the land which afterwards belonged
to the Edomites, and there they were called Horites from
mount Hor3 and the children of Seir, from Seir the father of
those families, he himself being a Canaanite. On the east,
they spread themselves into those countries which afterward
belonged to the Moabites, the Ammonites, the Midianites3
and they were called Keuites, Kenizzites, Cadmonites, from
one Cain, one Kenaz‚ and perhaps one Cadmon, the fathers
of those families; if so be the Cadmouites were not so called

Theo mention of a certain Cain calls to my mind the town
or city Cain, which you see in the maps placed not far from
Carmel ε iu that of Doet‚ adorned (shall I say ἓ) οι· disfigured
with a Dutch picture of one man shooting another, with this
inscription, ‘⁴ Cain wert geschoten vau Lamech ;” “ Cain was
shot by Lamech‚” Gen. iv. A famous monument forsooth!
That place, indeed, is obscure, Gen. iv: and made more ob-
scure by the various opinions of interpreters z and you, Doet‚
have chosen the worst of all. If the words of Lamech may be
cleared from the text, (and if you clear it not from the con-
text, whence will you clear it ἒ) they carry this plain and
smooth sense with them: He had brought in bigamy: that
also had laid waste the whole world, Gen. vi. For so wretched
a wickedness, and which, by his example, was the destruction
of infinite numbers of men, divine justice and vengeance strikes
and wounds him with the·horror and sting of conscience; so
that, groaning and howling before his two bigamous wives,
Adah and Zillah‚ he complains and confesseth that he is a
much more bloody murderer than Cain, for he had only slain
Abel ς but he, an infinited number of young aud old by his
wicked example.
