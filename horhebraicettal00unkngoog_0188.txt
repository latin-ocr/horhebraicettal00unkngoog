0223ss “In Adam,” the marginal hath D'ijp ‘⁶ Flrom Adam.”
You 'may very fitly apply both readings.

Adam was the centre, where the waters parted: here was
the station of the ark of the covenant‚ now ready to enter

Jordan. Hence the Psalmist, 0223} 3:115 Stil* The tabor-
naok which Ιιο had fiaeod in Adam, Psalm lxxviii. 60. 'Phere-

fore, the textual reading &2233 “ in Adam,” holds well; be-
cause there was the centre of the cutting in two of the waters:

but the marginal reading 022329 ‘⁸ from Adam‚’' does more-
over add light, because ψο gathering those waters together
on a heap was far above it.

“R. J ochanan saith 5, Adam is a city, and Zaretan is a city,
and they are distant from one another twelve miles.” From
Adam to Zaretan, were the waters dried up3 from Zaretan
and upwards‚ they stood on a heap. Adam was in Perea,
over-against J ericho; Zaretan was in the land of Manasseh
on this side Jordan. It is called Zarthanah‚ 1 Kings iv. 12,
and is defined to be near Beth-ehem, which was the furthest
bounds of the land of Manasseh northward. The brazen
vessels of the Temple are said ιο be cast in the plain of Jor-
dan, in the clay ground between Zaretan (on this side Jordan)
and Succoth (beyond it), 1 Kings vii. 46. 'Pherefore‚ the words
cited in Joshua, ιη’-ἒξ -τξτᾳ nugas, mm 0223} aba? ‚vr-nn
sar off from Adam, which is beside Zaretan‚ are so ιο be
understood, as not so much ιο denote the neamess of Adam
and Zaretan‚ as to intimate that the heaping up of the waters
was by Zaretan. They are ιο be rendered in this sense, “ And
the waters that came down from above stood together; they
rose up into one heap, in a very long distance from the city
Adam,” namely‚ ιο that distance, which is by Zaretan.

Adam and Zaretan, on this and the other side, were both
something removed from Jordan ε but they are named in that
story, because there the discourse is of the time, when Jordan
contained not itself within its own cbannel, but had overflown
its banks.
