the Glosser interpreting, was a certain street without the city
Gaza; where was a shambles, and where there also was an
idol-temple.

'Pheret is mentioned, also, the ‘ mart of Gaza,’ one of the
thme more famed marts,-to wit, that of Gaza, and of Aeo,
and of Boma, (mma.)

There η was a place also without the city, which was

in the Holy Bible, where we meet with these names.

Ascalon⁸ was distant from Jerusalem five hundred and

makes mention of a double Ascalon,—(this our) old, and the
