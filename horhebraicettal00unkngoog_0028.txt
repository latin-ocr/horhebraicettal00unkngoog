deed even with Arad, which is asserted in the text alleged,—
and if below these were En-gedi‚ which is also asserted by
the authors eited,—certainly, then, the maps have laid it a
long way distant from its own proper place, too much north-
ward. View them, and think of these things. To which we
also add this :—

The southern borders of the land, Ezek. xlvii. 19 (the very
same which are mentioned Num. xxxiv. and J osh. xv. 2), are

thus declared ; “ The southern coast southward from Tamar ·

to the waters of Meribah in Cadesh,” &00 But now Tamar
and En-gedi are the same, 2 Chron. xx. 2. Nor have we any
reason why we should seek another Tamar elsewhere. Ger-

tainly, the Ghaldee paraphrast, and Rabbi Sol. J archi, and

. Kimchi following him, have rendered Tamar, in Ezekiel‚

Joricho. But upon what reason? For how, I beseeoh you,
was it possible, that J ericho should be the bounds of the
south land, when it was the utmost bounds of J udea north-

glory of palm-groves.

Whether Tadmor, 1 Kings ix. 1 8, be the same with this
our 'saman—and whether Tadmor in the 'l'almudists be the
same with that Tadmor,—-we leave to the reader to consider.
We produce these few things concerning it, which are related
by them,—for the sake of such consideration :—

“ Theym receive proselytes from those of Cardya and Tad-
mor. Bab. Abhu, in the name of R. J oehauan, saith, The
tradition asserto, that the proselytos of Tadmor are fit to
enter into the congregation.'’ It was said a little beforez
“Haggai the prophet taught these three lessons t-—mt'l D'ss,
The rival of a daughter ’' (of a priest) “ may be married by a
priest. The Moabites and Ammonites ought to tithe the

poor's tithe the seventh year. And the proselytos of Tadmor
are fit to enter into the congregation.”
