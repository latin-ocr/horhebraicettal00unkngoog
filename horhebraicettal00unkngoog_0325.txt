Emmaus. 315

ΙΙ. The Syriae, Arabic, and Persian interpretem write the
name in the evangelist with an y at the beginning; the Sy-
riac and Persian mzeny. So also the Syriae in 1 Maec. iii.
40. But the Arabic omma the Talmudists ΟἸᾺῺΝ, with Ν
in the beginning. Indeed, in Talm. Bab. in Erachin, fol. 10. 1,
it is written omn-w but in the Misnaioth, printed by itself,

ΙΙΙ. J osephus commonly renders Chammath of Tiberias
(a place so called from the hot baths) by Ἀμμαοῦς, Amnum-5 ;

This author, upon this occasion, quotes some passages
out of Sozomen, in the sixth book of the Tripartite History,
which are in his fifth book, chap. 20; wherein the waters at ¹¹
Emmaus are celebrated not only sor their plenty and plea-
santness‚ but as they were wonderfully wholesome and me-
dicinal. For thus he: “ There is a city in Palestine, which
now hath the name of Nicopolis, of which the holy gospel

makes mention as os a village (for then it was so), καὶ Ἐμμᾶ .
