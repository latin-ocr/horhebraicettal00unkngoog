are numbered with the Philistines, but yet by themselves,
J osh. xiii. 3 z—for see there, how the hely text promising to
number five natione only, numbers sim.

This excluded portion is passed into the name of Idumea.
Hence Plinyt: ‘⁶ Presently from the rising up of the lake Sir-
bon, begins Idumea and Palestine.” Nor that alone, but
another very great part of J udea. Hence the sea of Sodom,
is said, by Diodorus Siculus, to be κατὰιι μέσην Ἰδουμαίαν,
“ about the middle of Idumea.” And in J osephus, and the
Book ottho Maccabeos, we find very many places mentioned
under the name of Idumea, which were almost in the very
middle of J udea. For example's sake; Ἦλθενι μέχρι Γαδάρων,
καὶ τῶν πεδίων τῆς Ἰδουμαίας, καὶ Ἀζῶτου, καὶ Ἰαμνείας· “ ΗΘ
came even to the Gadari, and the plains of Idumea, and Azo-
tus‚ and Jamnia.” And agaim Ὅ] δὲ Ἰούδας καὶ οἱ ἀδελφοὶ
αὐτοῦ πολεμοῦντες τοῖς Ἰδουμαίοις οὔκ ἀνίεσαν· ἀλλ’ ἐνέκειντο
πανταχόθεν αὐτοῖς. τήν τε Χεβρῶνα πόλιν καταλαβόμενοι, 8250.
καὶ Μόρισσαν πόλιν, 820. εἴς τε Ἀζωτον ἐλθόντες, ἔω. “ And
J udas and his brethren left not off fighting with the Idu-
means: but fell upon them everywhere: and taking the city
Ohebron, &c and the city Marissa. &c. And having come
unto Azotus,'' svo. And more to this purpose may be read
here and there. So that distinction may be made, between
Idumea the Greater and the Less. Simon of Gerasa [τὰς’-
ἆνᾶ τὴν Ὀρεινὴν κώμας κατέτρεχεν, διο. κατέτρεχε δὲ τὴν Ἀκρα-
βατηνὴν, καὶ τὰ μέχρι τῆς μεγάλης Ἰδουμαίας] overran the towns
along the mountainous country, &c And he overran Acra-
batene‚ and the parts as far as Idumea the Great.'' And there
is mention of rhua ἅνω καλουμένην Ἰδουμαίαν, “ Idumea, called
the Upper.'' With these passages, compare Mark iii. 8.

Whilst the Jews were absent from their own country,
- enduring the seventy years’ bondage in Babylon,—-it is easy
to be believed, that their ancient enemim, the Edomites, and
that were so from the very first original of them, had invaded
their possessions‚ as much as they could, and had fixed their
roots in that country especially, which was nearest their own:
