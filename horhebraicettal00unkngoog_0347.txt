Ben Mur. 387

for Jesus himself testified that a prophet hath no honour in
his country :” it looks this way3 that is, he would not go
into Nazareth, but into Galilee‚ viz. the Upper, and so came
to Cana.

Nazareth, therefore, was in the Lower Galilee, in the very
confines of Issachar and Zabulon, and is commonly received
within Zabulon, itself being distant sixteen miles or more
from Capernaum; for from Caper-naum, mount Tabor is dis·
tant ten miles, or thereabouts.

Smr. 111 .-Ἶ33 β Ben Nezer.

I AM not abundantly satisfied with the common writing of the
word ⁶ Nazareth,' by Ἕκ much less that ⁴ Nazarenus' should
be expressed by ἾἾΒὋ, i. e. Νωζαραῖος, when the sacred Ama-
nuenses write it Ναζωραῖος. But 1 can hardly suppress a
just indignation, when I read what the Jews scribble about

between the kingdom of Ahasuerua and the kingdom of Ben
Nezer, there is. Between thieves and thieves there is no dif-
ficulty; but between Ben Nezer and &01:2⁹ 0⁸20& the
thiam of the world viz. common tlaievee, there is. There [in

” Palestine] Ben Nezer is called a king: here [in Babylon] ho is

called a rabber, ''0*t00³¹7 3¹74) ἥρ. Gloss: ‘⁶ Ben Nezer
was a thies, and took cities. and ruled over them; and became
the captain of robbers.'’

It is very suspicions to what purpose they have invented
that name for the most infamous robber, to call him the “ son
of Nezer.” By those very letters 532 they write the city
⁴ Nazareth? Read on, and the suspicion will increase.
