Emmaus. K iriatlz-jearim.

‘⁶ Fuom Beth-horond to Emmaus it was hiuy.”-It⁰ was
sixty furlongs distant from Jerusalem—’oxmmacoaef δὲ μό·
νοις, ἀπὸ τῆς στρατιᾶς διαφιεμένοις, χωρίον ἔδωκεν (Οὐεσπασιανὸς)
εἷς κατοίκησιν, ὃ καλεῖται μὲν Ἀμμαοῦς, ἀπέχει δὲ τῶν Ἱεροσολύ-
μων σταδίους ἑξήκοντα. “ To eight hundred only, dismissed
the army, (Vespasian) gave a place, ealled Ammaus, for them
to inhabit : it is sixty furlongs distant from J erusalem.”

Ι inquire, whether this word hath the same etymology
with Emmaus near Tiberias, whieh, from the ‘ warm baths,’
was called ΠὮΠ ΟΙιαηιηιαιΙι. The Jews certainly do write
this otherwise 3 namely, either Dinnis, as the Jerusalem Tal-
mudists in the place above eited; or, ΟἸΝὩΨ, as the Misna.

‘⁶ Thes family (say they) of Beth-Pegarim, and Beth Zip-
peria was Dii-mum out qs Emmaus.’'-—The Gloss is this;
⁸· Emmaus was the name of a place, whose inhabitants were
Israelite gentlemen, and the priests married their daughters.”

J osephus, mentioning some noblemen, slain ¹² by Simeon
the tyrant, numbers one Aristeus, who was “ ai scribe of the
couneil γένος ἐξ Ἀμμαοῦς, and by extraction from Ammam.”
By the same author is mentioned also ’Ἃνανοςῑς ὅ ἀπ’ Ἀμ-
μαοῦς, “ Ananus of Ammaus,” one of the seditious of Jeru-
salem; who nevertheless at last ssed over to Caesar.

Kiriath-jeaiim was before-time ealled Baale, 2 Sam. vi. 2 ;
or Baalath, 1 Chron. xiii. 6. Goneerning it, the Jerusalem
writers speak thus; “ We¹ find, that they intercalated the
year iu Baalath. But Baalath was sometimes assigned to

Judah, and sometimes to Dan. Eltekah, and Gibbethon, and „
