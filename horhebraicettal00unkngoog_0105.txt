The country qs Jeriolco. 95

Baaleth3 behold, these are Judalzff' (Here is a mistake of
the transcribers, for it should be written. of Dan, Josh. xix.
44.) “ Baalah, and Jiim, and Azem,—behold, these are of
Dan’' (it should be written, of Judah, J osh. xv. 29)3 ‘⁴ namely,
the houses were of J udah,— the fields of Dan.''

Inm Psal. cxxxii. 63 “ We heard of it” (the ark) “in
Ephratah” (that is, Shiloh, a city of Ephraim); ‘⁶ we found
it in the fields of the wood'’ (Ἓξ Ἶὶᾩξι, that is, in Kiriath-
joarim, 1 sam. vii. 1, εω.) ’

ΟΗΑΡ. XLVI.
The country quoricBO, and tke situation qs the Oity.

Hm: we will borrow Josephus'sn pencil‚ Ἰδρυται μὲν ἐν
πεδίῳ, ψιλὸν δὲ ὑπέρκειται αὐτῆς καὶ ἄκαρπον ὅρος μήκιστον, 810.
“ Jericho is seated in a plain, yet a certain barren mountain
hangs over it, narrow, indeed, but long; for it runs out north-
ward to the country of Scythopolis,-—and southward, to the
country of Sodom, and the utmost coast of the Asphaltites.”

Of this mountain mention is made, Josh. ii. 22, where the
two spies, sent by Joshua, and received by Rahab, are said
to “ conceal themselves.''

Ἀυτίκειται δὲ τούτῳ τὸ περὶ τὸν Ἰορδάνην ὅρος, 830. “ Op-
posite against this, lies a mountain on the other side Jordan,
beginning from J ulias on the north, and stretched southward
as far as Somorrha‚ which bounds the rock of Arabia„ In
this is a mountain, which is called the Iron mountain, reach-
ing out as far as the land of Moab. But the country which
lies between these two mountainous places, is called the Great
plain (Μέγα πεδίον), extended from the village Ginnaber to
the lake Asphaltites, in length a thousand two hundred fur-
longs” (a hundred and fifty miles), “in breadth, a hundred
and twenty furlongs” (fifteen miles); and Jordan cuts it in
the middle.''

Hence you may understand more plainly those things that
are related of “ the plains of Jerich0,’' 2 Kings xxv. 5 3 and
what ἡ περίχωρος τοῦ Ἰορδάνου, “ the region about J ordan,”
means, Matt. iii. 5.
