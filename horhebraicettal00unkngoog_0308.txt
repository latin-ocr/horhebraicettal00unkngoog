does not sit in the shadow of his tabernaclo beyond twenty
cubits, but in the shadow of its sides” [that is, if the roos
or cover of his tabernaclo be above twenty cubits high] .
“ Abai saith unto him, If, therefore, any one¹² shall pitch a
tabernaclo in Ash turoth-karnaim, is not the tabernaclo so
also ?”' Gloss: ‘⁸ Ashtaroth-karnaim were two great moun-
tains, with a valley between; and, by reason of the height
and shadow of those mountains, the sun never shone upon
the valley.”

Why the Samaritan copy should uso hero ΠὋἾΡ tvvm?
Aphinitlz Karnaiah, instead of ‘ Ashtaroth-karnaim‚' espe-
cially when it retains the word Ashtaroth elsewhere, is not
easy to say, unless it should have some relation to ΓΒΚ)

That the Zuzims inhabited Perea, as it is distinguished
from the country of Bashan, may be evident from the pro-

were amongst the Rephaims, when they were distinguished
both in nation and dwelling. The Samaritan, we may bo sure,
took ῦζῒᾉ for no other than a placo, when it renders ΠΦἽῘὩΞ
in Lisltah.

When the Israelites went out of Egypt into that land, tho
whole Transjordanino region was divided into these two
seigniories,--the kingdom of Sehon, and the kingdom of og.
That of Sehon was Perea, strictly so called now; that of
og, was all the rest under the name of Bashan. But after
the return of Israel from Babylon, Bashan was so subdivided,
that Batanea‚ or Bashan‚ was only a part of it, the rest going
