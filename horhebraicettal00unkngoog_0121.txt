second3 others to the third, and so to the tenth. From the
tenth to the rock ΠΒ Dok, whence the goat was cast down,
were two miles. They, therefore, who received him there,
went not farther than a mile with him, that they might not
exceed a sabbath day's journey: but, standing there, they
observed what was done by him. “ He snapped the scarlet
thread into two parts, of which he bound one to the horus of
the goat, and the other to the rock: and thrust the goat
down3 which, hardly coming to the middle of the precipice,
was dashed and broke into pieces. The rock Tsok therefore
was twelve miles distant from Jerusalem, according to later
computation. But there are some, who assign nine-tenths
only, and ten miles.—See the Gemarists.

say to the high-priest‚ The goat is now come into the wilder-
ness.'' But whence knew they, that he was now come into
the wilderness3 They set up high stones; and, standing on
them, they shook handkerchiefs; and hence they knew that
the goat was now got into the wilderness. R. J udah saith,

From these things compared, it is no improbable conjec-

both was twelve miles distant from Jerusalem, and had rough
and very craggy rocks near it: and that the sense of the
