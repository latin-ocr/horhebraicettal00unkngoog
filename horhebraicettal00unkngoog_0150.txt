What is to bo said os ᾺἿῸΕΝἾ ΝΟἾ, the soa qs Apamia.

&mats-¹ rm* ‘ The sea of Apamia' is reckoned the seventh
among those seas that compass the land of Israel; which
word hath a sound so near akin to the word Pamias‚ by
which name the Rabbins point out the fountains of Jordan,
—that the mention of that word cannot but excite the me-
mory of this, yea, almost persuade that both design one
and the same place: and that the sea Apamia was nothing
else but some great collection of waters at the very springs
of Jordan.

Thisb also might moreover be added to strengthen that
persuasion‚ that, in both places, in the quotations cited in
the Jerusalem Talmud, these words are added; ‘⁴ The sea
of Apamia is the same with the sea of Ohamats, which
ῦἹῬῑΦιΞΡἸἾ Diocletianus, by the gathering together of the
waters, caused to be made.” But now that Diocletianus,
whosoever he was (we prove elsewhere that he was the em·
peror), lived sometime at Paneas ; as is clear also from the
same Talmud 0.

But the thing is otherwise. Pamias and Apamia were
different places, and far distant from each other: one in the
land of Israel; the other in the confines indeed of the land of
Israel, but in Syria.

Let this tradition be marked :—“ Aristond brought his
first-fruits from Apamia, and they were received: for they
said, He that hath a possession in Syria, is as if he had it in
the suburbs of Jerusalem.’' The Gloss is, “Apamia is the
name of a place in Syria.”

And these things do appear more clearly in the Tar-
gumists, to omit other authors. The Samaritan interpreter
rendere the word 02:27 (Shepham,) N umb. xxxiv. 10, by rmus>

Apamia, with 9 (Ain). (N ote Φ (Shin) changed into 37 (Ain) t
note also, in the word Bozor‚ 2 Pet. ii. 15, 37 (Ain) changed
into Φ (Shin).) J onathan reads it mnne& Apamia, with
a (Aleph): for ”ba-73⁸ anxyr? ‘⁴ From Shepham to niblah,”

he renders *nn-1¹7 o'lN'UDN p: ⁴ From Apamia to Daphne?
