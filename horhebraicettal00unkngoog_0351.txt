tradition. Abba Chalaphtha of Caphar Hananiah, in the
name of R. Meir‚ saith,'' [they are in Bavah Mezia, where he
is brought in, and what ιω saidq]‚ we: ψη rrum ne: ³: 5²3³
ru: ‘⁶ It seems to me” (they are the words of t-he author of
J uchasin) ‘⁴ that Caphar Hananiah is Caphar Cana3 as may
be proved out of the ninth chapter of the book Sheviith: for
there was the entrance of the Lower Galilee.”

From that place, quoted in Sheviith, which is Hal. 2, it
plainly appears that Caphar Hananiah was in the very out-
most border that divided the Upper and the Lower Galilee.
From whence it is evident‚ that the entrance of the Lower
Galilee, according to our author, was not as we go from
Samaria to Galilee‚ but from the Upper Galilee into the
Lower. And whether our Cana of Galilee be so called to
distinguish it from that Cana that so divides between the
two Galilees, or from that Cana that was in the tribe of Asher
(which may not unfitly be called ‘ Cana of the Sidonians’), it
is at the reader's choice to determine ¹. As als0, why the
Syriae interpreter should in this place write &zap Kalaa, in-
stead of ‘ Cana.’ Whether he had in his eye or mind timp
Kauana, J osh. xix. 15, which, in the vulgar dialect, was called
Κατανᾶθ, ΚαταπαιΙι, as the Seventy render it, and the Jeru-
salem Talmudists affirm⁸; or whether by a diminutive kind
of word ⁸3²0? Katanalz, he would intimate the smallness os
the town: q. d. “ Cana the Less.''
