Σαλλὶμ, Sallim3 in the Roman Σεγαλὶμ, Soqalim3 where the
‘rm-gum, instead of πφὲιρ ma επ tae zama of statem,

υἷος-ζμ] 57²3ss in tho land os Sanam, it hath sanna vas:
in the'land qf‘Metkbao-a. But why both here and also 2 Kings

iv. 42, they should render Πζύᾴἳζῖ ‘7223 Baal-slaalislaa ¹ by

&mv ῨἾΝ the land qs clue south, we find some kind os reason
in the Gemarists, who upon this place have this note:

‘⁶ There? was no country throughout the whole land of lsrael
where the fruits of the earth were so forward as in Baal-Sha·
lisha.‘' Now such a country they call mun-nnn ⁸ nwm
southern fidele,- or literally, made south,· “ because the sun
both riseth and sets upon them.” But why they should render
rafim γης the land of saalim, marm γπκ cae caud of
Methbara⁸ is something more unintelligible, unless it should
be with some respect to mount Tabor, which we find men-
tioned in the following chapter, ver. 3 ; and so &nm-m Moth-
bara, should be ‘⁶ the plain of Tabor.”

If now the reader can pitch upon any of these places we
have already named, or any other he may have met with in
his reading, as that which our evangelist here meaneth, let
him consider whether the article τοῦ may properly be prefixed
to it, when as the names of all cities and towns are of the
feminine gender generally, and yet St. John bath it τοῦ
Σαλείμ· which gives some ground of conjecture that the pas-
sage is to be understood not of any town or city, but of some
other matter3 which, by way of exercitatiori, it may not be
amiss-e. little to enlarge upon.
