of the Maccabees f, Καὶ Ἰόππην ὠχύρωσε τὴν ἐπὶ τῆς θαλάσσης,
καὶ τὴν Γάζαρα τὴν ἐπὶ τῶν ὁρίων Ἀζώτου· “ And he fortified
J oppe, which is on the sea, and Gazara, which is on the bor·
ders of Azotus.”

At length, according to the idiom of the Syrian dialect,
3(Zain) passed into Ἴ (Daleth); and instead of Gazara, it was
called Gadara. Hence Strabo, after the mention os J amnia,
saith 8, καὶ ἡ Γαδαρίς ἔστιν, εἶτ’ ’Ἄζωτος καὶ Ἀσκάλωνε “ and
there is Gadaris, then Azotus and Ascalon.'’ And a little
asten ‘⁸ Philodemus the Epicurean was a Gadarene, and so
was Meleager and Menippus, ὁ σπουδογελοΐος, surnamed the
‘ ridiculous student,' and Theodorus the rhetorician,” διο.

But the other Gadara, which we seek, was in Perea, and
was the metropolis of Perea. Ἐλθόντων ἐπὶ τὰ Γάδαρα, Μη-
τρόπολιν τῆς Περαίας καρτεράν· “ Being come into the parts
of Gadara, the strong metropolis os Perea. ” T} ey are the
words of J osephus b. ,

It was sixty furlongs distant from Tiberias¹ ,by the mea-
sure of the same author.

“Gadara k, the river Hieramax [ἾῚΌἾἾ Jarmoc, of which
before] flowing by it, and now called Hippodion.'' Some
reckon it among the cities of the country of Decapolis.

Another ¹⁵ city, also ‘ Gergesa' by name, was so near to it,
that that which in Mark is called χῶρα Γαδαρηνῶν, ‘ the
country of the Gadarenes,' chap. v. 1,—in Matthew is χώρα
Γεργεσηνῶν, ‘ the country of the Gergesenes,' chap. viii. 28:
which whether it took its name from the Girgashites, the
posterity of Oanaan,—-or from the clayish nature of the soil,
(ΝΠΦἾᾹἿᾹ Garyishta, signifying dogm—we leave to the more
learned to be decided. The Chaldee certainly rendere that
mamm) ”my thick div-t, which’ ιε in the Hebrew ΠὉἻᾺΠ *mma

the clay yround, 1 Kings vii. 46.
The Jerusalem writers say, that ¹¹² the Girgashitea when

J oshua came, and proclaimedst ‘He that will go out hence,
let him go,’ ⁹—betook themselves into Africa.
