take its name from the pleasantowss of its situation, according
to the description that J osephusi giveth of it¹¹3 yet the
oriental interpretem write it the latter way. The Rabbins

to take this story:

‘⁶ Chanina ¹, R. J oshua's brother's son, went into ΟῚΠΞ nn:
capernaum, mbr: *nm rw& pww and tho heretica ’⁹ (01-
may-iciam, for the word signifies either) “ mahamet} him.
They brought him into the city sitting upon an ass 3⁹⁹ on t-he
sabbath-day, which was forbidden by their law. “ He went

J onathan, g0, and rejoicing tell thy mother, that thou didst
not so much as look back towards us 3 for if thou hadst
looked back, thou hadst then followed us as vehemently as we
have now followed thee.’''

While I read these things, I cannot but call to mind the
Nicolaitans, and such who indulged to themselves a. liberty
