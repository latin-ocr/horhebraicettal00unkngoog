μεν] τόν τε τῆς ἄνω πόλεως, καὶ τὸν κάτω λόφον διαστέλλων,
καθήκει μέχρι Σιλωάμ. “ The vale of the Tyropoei” (or the
oheemnonqers), “ that divided between the hill of the Upper
City and the Lower, went down unto Siloam.” The entrance
into this vale, probably, was eastward by the Horse-gate, and
the street (the most noted of the whole city) went onward to
the west. ’

IV. ῙἹἾῙὩὨΠ ΡἸΦ The Upper Street.—-“ Any⁶ spittle‚ found
in the city, was clean, except that which was found in the
upper street.” The Gloss thus; ‘⁴ The spittle of any unclean
person is unclean, and defiles. But strangers of another
country are as unclean among us, as those that have a flux.
Now the strangers dwelt in the upper street.” Here I re-
member the story of Ismael Ben Oamithi‚ the highpriest3
whod when he went out on the day of expiation to speak
with a certain (heathen) captain, some spittle was sprinkled

defiled, he could not perform the service of that day: his
brother therefore officiated for him.

locked the door '' (on the sabbath), “ and laid the key in the
window which was above the door. R.. J ose saith, That this
was in the street of those that dealt in wool.''

Josephus hath these words, Kaobs καὶ τῆς Καινῆς πόλεως,

city there was a wool-market‚ and braziers’ shops‚ and a
market of garments.''
