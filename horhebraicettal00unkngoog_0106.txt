δὲ Ἰορδάνου ἑξήκοντα, &c. “ Jericho is distant from Jerusa-
lem a hundred and fifty fnrlongs” (eighteen miles and three
quartem), “and from Jordan sixty furlongs” (seven miles and
a half). “ The space from thence to Jerusalem is desert and
rocky; but to Jordan and the Asphaltiten, more plain, indeed,
but alike desert, and barren.”

This our author asserts the same distance between J ericho
and Jordan elsewhere, in these words: 01⁰ δὲ, πεντήκοντα
προελθόντες στάδια, βάλλονται στρατόπεδον ἀπὸ δέκα σταδίων τῆς
Ἱεριχοῦντος· “ But the IsraeliteS, travelling forward fifty fur-
longs from Jordan, encamped the distance of ten furlongs
from J ericho :” that is, in Grilgal‚ in the east coast of J ericho,
J osh. iv. 19.

But concerning the distance between J ericho and J eru-
salem, he does not seem to agree with his countrymen. For,
however they, according to their hyperbolical style, feign
very many things to be heard from Jerusalem as far as Je-
1·icho,—to wit P, the sound of the gate of the Temple, when it
was opened,—the sound of Migrephah, or the little bell, &a
yet there are some of them, who make it to be the distance
of ‘ ten parsaeJ' “ Rabbathq Bar Bar Channah saith, Rabbi
Jochanan saith, ’⁹055'ss 'tl-¹³5⁴? ’ΦἹἾἾὮ from Jerusalem to
Jerioho were ten parsae : and yet, from thence thither the
voice of the high-priest, in the day of expiation, pronouncing
the name Jelaovak, was heard, &a The hinges os the gates
of the Temple are heard mlv *mv-m ΠΠἹΌΦΞ as far as tho
oiylzth bound οῖ’ the sabbath ,·” that is, as far as a sabbath-day's
journey eight times numbered. The Gloss hath these words3
“ The hinges, indeed, not farther, but the gates themselves
are heard to Jericho.'’ There is an hyperbole in their mea·
suring of the space, as well as in the rest.

Ἐκπυρῶται δὲ ὥρᾳ θέρους τὸ πεδίον, καὶ δι’ ὑπερβολὴν αὔχ-
μοῦ περιέχει νοσώδη τὸν ἀέρα, 8ω. “ And that plain burne in
the summer, and, by too much heat, rendere the air unhealth-
ful: sor it is all without water, except Jordan ς the palms that
grow in whose banks are more flourishing and more fruitfnl
than those that grow more remote.''
