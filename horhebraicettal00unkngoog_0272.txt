upon them, the land of Israel shook four hundred parsoe

every way.”

070·ng A parsu contains in it four miles. ‘⁸ Ten parsaeh
(saith the Gloss at the place in the margin) are forty miles :”
which might be proved largely elsewhere, if need were.
So that four hundred parsae (or so many thirty furlongs),
made a thousand six hundred miles. Which measure why
they ascribed it to the land of Israel on every side of the
square of it, whether from the measurings of Ezekiel, or
from somewhat else, we do not here inquire. But we can-
not but observo this, that the same number is mentioned,
and perhaps the same measure understood, Rev. xiv. 20:
⁶⁴ Blood issued out of the lake to the horses' bridles, for a
thousand six hundred furlongs.” Where the Arabio reads,

&gbk—9 ..st >bg-ol ‘⁸ so‘r the space of a thousand six hundred
miles.”

The Talmudists measure sometimes by miles, sometimes by
parses, sometimes by diets. Every one os these you will meet
with in them very frequently.

Os the Talmudic mile, take this admonition of theirs: 'mn
ε εὴ mn rm *rm rmum mm namely‚ that “ it
consistedi” (not of eight, as the Greek and Roman did, but)
“ of seven furlongs and a half.” For by what other word to
render ΟἾἾ 1 know not3 nor do 1 think it to be rendered by
any other.

And of the diet, take this: ‘⁶ R. Joohanank saith, ΠὩΞ
nv: m& ἹῙῬΠὩ How much is a man’s journey in one day?
nit-tows '³ ten parces. From the first dawning of the mora·-
ing to sun-rise, five miles. From sun-set until stars appear,

five miles. zan-w &abab swam nomn pn'vn nb wo

hold a day’s journey of forty miles in one sense, that is, as
much as may be despatched in one day; and of thirty in an-
other, that is, as much as most usually was wont to be de-
spatched. Where you are admonished by them alac, that
these are computed ³:5³³: ειν) “ according to the equinoctia!
