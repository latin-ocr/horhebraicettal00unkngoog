Asphaltites. fronts it on the west, and Machaerus situated on
the north, fronts it on the south ;'‘ otherwise, you would
remove Machaerus a great way from its proper situation.

We meet with it in the Talmudists under the name of
Macvar.

“ The mountainous country of Perea was the hill Macvar
and Gedor.” The Jerusalem Targumn, and J onathan upon
Numb. xxxii. 35, instead of “ Atroth, Shophan, and Jaazer,''
have amr: nn lew-v nnbbnn Π· “ Maclelta of Shophan
and Macvar:” to which Jonathan adds &mma ἾἹἸΞὈ
“ Macvar of Garamatha.”

It is obvious enough how they came to render ΠἹἾῘΩὩ
Atroth by &rublum Maclelta, (as also Onkelos hath done);
viz. because they translated the Hebrew word, which denotes
a eroum, by the Ghaldee word, which is of the same signifi-
cation. But why Jaazer by ἾῚὈὉ Mac-var? Onkelos upon
the third verse of the same chapter, renders ‘ J aazer’ and
‘ Nimrah’ by ΓἾὩ) ΓΡΖΠ pam), which I should translate,
‘⁶ the Ata-ati or deniyrati of the house of Nimrin.” And Pto·
lemy comments thus in Arabia Petraea: Διατείνει δὲ ἐν τῇ
χώρᾳ τὰ καλούμενα μέλανα ὅρη, ὣο. “ There are all along
that country certain mountains called the Black Mountains,
namely, from the bay which· is near Pharan, to J udea.” But
whether nunt: Maovar hath any relation with Machmas from⁰
ww: a dish or samace, Ι leave it to others to inquire.

So that we see Herodium and Machaerus are situated on
the outermost coast of Perea towards the south, or the land
of Moab, near the shore of Asphaltites, or the Dead sea.

The nature of the place we have described by Josephus,
Ῥέουσι δὲ καὶ θερμῶν ὑδάτων πηγαὶ κατὰ τὸν τόπου Ρ, &c-
“ There spring out, near this place, certain fountains of hot
waters, of a very different taste, some bitter some sweetg
there are also many springs of cold waters,” διο. Compare
the bitter waters with the water-s of Nimrin‚ Isa. xv. 6, and
the other with those of Dimon‚ ver. 9 ς where, query whether
Dimon be not the same with Dibon [Beth (2) and Mem (ῃ)
being alternately used]; that by that pronunciation it might.
