Weigh this storyu: ‘⁶ One¹ brought a bill of divoree to
R. Ismael; who said to him, Whenee are you? He answered‚
5:27 ΕἹΠΠΞΦ ”DD 52:222 From Caphar Samni, which ὼ
in the confines of Aona—Thon it is needful, saith he, that
you say, It was written, I being present,—and sealed, 1
being present. When he went out, R. Illai said unto him, Is
not Caphar Samai of the land of Israel, being nearer to
Zippor than Aeon Y' And a little after: ‘⁶ The eities which
are in t-he borders of Zippor near to Aeon, and which are in
the borders os Aeon near to Zippor‚ what will you do eon-
eerning them? As Aeon is, so is Zippor.”

‘⁶ TRAVELLINGY from Aeon to Aehzib‚ on the right hand
of the way, eastwardly, it is clean, from the notion of heathen
land, and is bound to tithes‚ and to the law of the seventh
year, until you are certified that it is free. On the left hand
of the way, westward, it is unelean, under the notion of
Gentile land; and it is free from tithes, and from the law
eoneerning the seventh year, till you are certified it is bound
to those things, even until you come to thzib.” The Gomara
hath these words: but the text, on which is this commentat-y,
is this ε “ Thez three countries'' (namely‚ J udea, Galilee‚ and
Perea) “ are bound to the law of the seventh year: whatso-
ever they possessed, who came up out of Babylon, from the
land of Israel unto ΣΝ) Olzezib (the Jerusalem Misna reads
2³32 erzih), is not fed nor tilled: but whatsoever they
possessed, who eame up out of Egypt, from Chezib to the
river, and to Amanah, is sed, but not tilled ι from the river
and from Amanah‚ inwards, is sed and tilled.”
