Bn‘rwsnx Lydda and the sea, a spacious valley runs out,
here and there widely spreading itself, and sprinkled with
villages. The holy page os the New Testament [Acts ix. 3 5.]
calls it Saron, τὸν Σάρωνα; and that of the Old calls the whole,
perhaps, or some partos it, ‘ the plain of Ono,' N eh. vi. 2, xi. 35,

The wine of Sharon is of great fame, with h which they
mixed two parts water: and remarkable is that they say
concerning the houses of Sharon. R. Lazar saith ¹, “ He
that builds a brick house in Shamn, let him not return
back :'’ which was allowed to others, Deut. xx. 5,—namely‚
that they should return back from the war, if they had built
a new house, and it were not yet dedicated. “ But ¹¹ the men
of Sharon withdrew not themselves back '' (they are the words
of the Jerusalem Gamara)‚ “ because they repaired their
houses within seven years: and the chief priest also prayed
for them on the day of expiation‚ that their house might not
become their graves.'' The Gloss upon the Babylonian Tal-
mud thus3 ‘⁶ Sharon was the name of a place, whose ground
was not fit for bricks: and therefore, they often repaired
their houses within seven years.”

Among the villages‚ scattered up and down in this pleasant
vale, we meet with Caphar Lodim, between Lydda and the
sea. There is mention of it in the book Gittin, in the very
