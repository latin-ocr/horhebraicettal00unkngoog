AEnon. 345

we may remark, that the word Middin oeeurs J udges v. 10:

Γῖῐᾯ ¹5²9 *gaji* which if I should render, “ ye that dwell by
Middin‚''1 should have Kimohi to warrant me, who, in his
notes upon this place, tells us, that “Middin is the name of
a eity mentioned in J oshua‚ Middin and Seeaeah.'' But now,
when Αἰνὼν, AEnon, signifies a placo ⁰f rinqs 01· waler&
see what· follows3 ῦᾛὶζὶῐρἲὲ Γξίῑ ww Ρῗῷ “ from the
noise of arehers among th'e places of dravving waters.” The
Greek is ἀνὰ μέσον ὑδρευομένων, “ Among those that draw
water.” So that if you ask the Greek interpreter why he
should render Middin by Αἰνὼν, AEmn, a place of spargas,
he will tell -you, because Middin was a place ὑδρευομένων, “ of
those that draw waters.''

The Essenes sueeeeded the Kenites in their dwelling in
the wilderness of J udahb: and not only so, but in strietness
and austerity of life, as J osephus and others assure us. Now
if we will but allow the ‘ Essenes' to be called rmnssm Sal-
means, as the Kenites were, then the words of the evangelist
might bear sueh sense as this ;—“ John was baptizing in
AEnon near the Essenes.'' And it may be supposed, that as
the Baptist had already eonversed with two of the J ewish
seete, the Pharisees and Saddueees, and had baptized some
of each θ, so he would now apply himself to a third sect
amongst them, viz. the Essenes, and baptize some of them
too, But herein I will not be positive.

Secr. lV.—T710 Syriae remarked. And Eustatltius

τφοη Dionysius.
, Wmns'r we are treating upon the word Αἰνὼν, AEmm, I
cannot but observo that the word is divided both in the
Syriae and Arabio version: Syriae, p* Γνὲ “ In the fountain
Jon :'’ Arabio p] 1³37 “D “ In the fountain Nun.'' The
words of the evangelist seem to discover the signification of
the name.

Ὅτι ὕδατα πολλὰ ἦν ἐκεῖ, “ Because there was mueh water
there.'' For we eould not have rendered the word more
significant-ly, than a placo os spu-inm, or a watery place. So
Nonnus;

’Υδοτι βαπτίζων βαθυκῦμονος ἕγγνθι Σαλήμ.
Baptizing near the wetere os deep-waved Salem.
