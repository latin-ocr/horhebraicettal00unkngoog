purgas is, to measure out the breadth of the land within

Smer. III.—Tlae Talmmbists' measuriny the broadtla of the
land within Jordan.

Tanna was a tradition and national custom famous among
them, concerning which we have mention somewhere, m:
-τκ ¹72¹:- ans tar *pbrm nahmi-¹³¹7 abu> nin *xm ·· Thatq
a vineyard of four years old, should go up to Jerusalem in a
day's journey on every side.'' The sense of the tradition is
this; the second tithes were either to be eaten at Jerusalem,
or, being sold at home, the money was to be brought to J eru-
salem, whence some things were bought. to be caten there.
Now pro‘vision is made by this canons, that the tithes of
vineyards which were within a diet of the city, should not be
sold, but that they should be brought to Jerusalem and eaten
there.

So both Misnas. But the Babylonian Gemara, in the
places· noted in the margin, reads DDRU 30 155³& “ Elath
on tlte north, Acrabat on the south.'' By what reason, and
in what sense, these words agree, commentators endeavour to
resolve obscurely enough; but it is not of so much moment
to detain us.

Elath recalls to my mind some things which are spoken by
the Notitia of the eastern empire. VVhere, ‘⁶ under the dis-
position of t-he honourable man, the duke of Palestine,’' is
substituted, among others, ‘⁴ Praefectus legionis decimae Fre-
tensis Ailae, The lientenant of the tenth Fretensian legion at
Aila.” Where Pancirolus writes, that “ Aila was seated on
the shore of the Red sea.” St. Jerome, upon Ezek. xlvii.
writes thus3 “the tongue of the Red sea, on the shore of
