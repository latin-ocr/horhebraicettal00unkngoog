not only straitened according as they are enlarged ς but it is
straitened also by the territories of ‘Pyre and Sidon running
between it and the sea.

So that it would be in vain to trace out an exact breadth
of the land every where} and it would be ridiculous to mea-
sure it by any one measure or extension. It is well enough,

if one come near the thing by some convenient guess here
and there, or err not much of it.

The determination of the lenqth of the land seems more
sure, while it is measured out by towns and cities, from Sidon
to the river of Egypt z but here also is not the same space to
all; and in some places the measuring is very uncertain.

Thus the Itinerary of Antoninus :—

From Sidon to Tyre (Phoenicia) 24 miles.

 

To Ptolemais ....... 32
Sicamina ........ 24
Oaesarea . . δ ...... 20
Betaro (palestine) ..... 1 8
Diospoli ........ 22

Ascalon ......... 20
Gaza .......... 16

We have elsewhere measured out this space by the oords
of Pliny and Strabo, less than this number by thirteen
miles: where if some mistake hath crept into the computar-
tion‚ let Gulielmus Tyrius bear the blame, who stretched
the bounds of Phoenicia four or five miles only from Tyre
southward.

But what shall we say of another Itium-ary? Which whether
it be Antoninus’s 1 dare not define; where it is thus,

From Caesarea to Betaron 31 miles:
To Diospolis . . . . . 38 miles:
exceeding the former computation nine-and-twenty miles.
