’γῇ-ἔρῃ ‘ The men of Orbo of thy merchandise,’ Ezek. xxvii.
27. Hence you may smell the reason why the Arabio rendere

it Orabimos [5423] To which sense our R. J udah, who

thinks that they were not ravam, but the inhabitants os the
city of Orbe, that ministered to Elias. But here the objection
of Kimchi holds ε “‚God commanded Elias (saith he), that he
should hide himself, that none should know thatb he was there.
And we see that Ahab sought him every where,” &a

But omitting the triflingness of the dream, we are search-
ing after the chorographical concern: and if there be any
truth in the words of R. Judah‚ that there was a city ‘may
Orba by name near Beth-ehem, we find the situation of the
brook Oherith‚-—or, at least, where he thought it ran. That
brook had for ever laid hid in obscurity, had not Elias lay
hid near it; but the place os it as yet lies hid. There are
some maps which fix it beyond Jordan, and there are others
fix it on this side 3 some in one place, and some in another,
uncertainly, without any settled place. But Ι especially
wonder at J osephus‚ who saith, that ἀνεχώρησεν εἰς r& πρὸς
νότον μέρη, ποιούμενος παρὰ χειμάρρῳ τινὶ τὴν διατριβήν· “ hec
went· away towards the north, and dwelt near a certain
brook ;'' when God in plain words saith, And thou skalt
turn thee, or 9⁰ towards the east, '‘V-2³³? ηιξ ῃᾬςῆε for he
was now in Samaria. God adds, ‘⁶ Hide thee at the brook
aharith, ffiQU·'2²-}> ἐξ *cjx-5 which ει wore Jordan.” so,
you will say, was every brock that flowed into Jordan. But
the sense of those words, ‘⁶ which is before J ordan,” is this,
“ which (brunk), as thou goest to Jordan, is flowing into it
on this side J ordan.’' So that although the Rabbin mis-
takes concerning the creaturos that fed Elias, yet perhaps
he does not so mistake concerning the place where the brook
wasn.

The story of the Syrophoenician woman, beseeching our
Saviour for her possessed daughter, and os his return thence
by Decapolis to the sea of Galilee, hath occasioned a dis-
course of ‘ the coasts of Tyre and Sidon, and the region of
Decapolis? And novur, having finished the search after the

places, let us speak one word of the woman herself. She is
