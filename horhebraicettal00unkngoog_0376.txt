Ir is an even lay, whether the Targumist on this place deal
more cunningly or more obscurely. The passage is about
the king’s gardens : and 116 “ Ι planted mc all trees of spice,

The meaning of the Targumist seemeth to be this; that
the king’s gardens were bounded in this manner. They ex-

wall of the city, which is in Jerusalem : which wall runs near
to the bank of the waters of Siloam.

That passage in Neh. iii. 15 illustrates this; ‘⁶ the gat-e
of the fountain repaired Shallum, 61111 1116 wall of 1116 pool
os Shelahh by the king's gardens.” ‘ The gate of the foun-

otherwise, was 61 601116 distance from the king's pool, Neh.

and the pool, there was a rivulet, drawn from the fountain
into that pool.
