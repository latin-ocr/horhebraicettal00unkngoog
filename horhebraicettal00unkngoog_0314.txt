But long before that, viz. in the days of the kings of Israel, it
was called the Grove of Libanus.”

VVhere at length shall we find this ltnrea? Had Philip any
part of his tetrarchy within Cyrrhestica, or Chalcis of Syria?
And yet, if you believe either Pliny or Strab0, there were the
Itureans. Ι suspect there is something couched in the ety-
mology of the word, that may as much puzzle as the situation
of the place.

lf Bacar‚ as it is described by Tyrius, be indeed Iturea‚ it
may be derived from ἾἹΠῚὩ Ηίτίῑιν, which signifies woalth ,-
or from ἾἹῙΔΨ, which denotes mwnz'ngy, especially when the
country itself ie crowned with so much plenty. lt is a notion
familiar enough amongst the Talmudic authors.

Indeed, if I could believe that Iturea were the same with
Decapolis, then I would suppose the word ἿΦᾯ ten might
have been altered by the change of ω (Shin) into Π (Thau),
according to the Syriae manner: but I neither ean believe
that, nor have I ever met with such a change made in that
word, but rather that it would go into D (Samech).

May it not, therefore, be derived from ’ἾἹΠἾΠ Clamare,
diyqinqs, because of the caves and hollows underground3
So that the Iturei might signisy the same with Troglodytae,
“ those that dwell in caverns and holes.” And so the Trog-
lodytes, which were on the north of Israel, are distinguished
from those on the south, viz. the Horites in Edom. Now
that these connisi-ies, of which we are treating, were peculiarly
noted for caves and dens 3 and they not only numerous, but
some very strange and wonderful„ Strabo, J osephus, Tyrius,
and others, do abundantly testify.

“ There are, beyond Damascus, two mountains called Tra-
chones.'’ Afterward3 ‘⁴ Towards Arabia and ltux-ea, there
are some cragged hille, famous for large and deep caves3 one
of which was capable of receiving four thousand men in it.”
But that was a prodigious cave of Zedekiah's, wherever it
was, that was eighteen miles' space 3 at least, if those things
be true which are related concerning it ¹¹.

There was a cave beyond Jordan, about sixteen miles from
