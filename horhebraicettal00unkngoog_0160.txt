ΠῸΠ Chammath. Ammaus. ΝἾὊω 'nn The warm bathe
qs Tiberias.

ΟΗΑΜΜΑΤΗ and Rakkath are joined together, J osh. xix. 35.
For they were very neighbouring cities ; Rakkath is Tibe-
rias‚—and Chammath κώμη Ἀμμαοῦς, the town Ammaus, in
J osephuS.

Of their neighbourhood, the Jerusalem Talmudists¹1 write
thus: “ The men of a great city may walk'’ (on the sabbath)
“ through a whole small city'' (which was within a sabbath·
day’s journey) ; “ but the inhabitants of a small city walk not

the men of Tiberias walked through all Chammath 3 but the
men of Chammath passed not beyond the arch: but now

was built, as it seems, on both the banks of Jordan, the two
parts of the town joining by a bridge.

“ Rabbah ⁸ said, Chammath is the same with the warm
baths of Gadara, and Rakkath is Tiberias.’'

“ Itt was lawful for the Gadarenes‚ R. J udah Nasi per·
mitting them, to go down into Chammath [on the sabbath],
and to return into Gadara: but the men of Chammath
might not go up into Gadara.’'

Behold ! Tiberias so near to Chammath. that it was almost
one city with it: and Chammath so near to the country of
Gadara, that thence it took the name of ‘ Chammath of Ga·
