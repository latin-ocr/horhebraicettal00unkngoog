Perea. ΓΙἾἾΠ Ὃν Beyond Jordan.

“ Tus lengthl of Perea was from Macherus to Pella: the
breadth from Philadelphia to J ordan.”

“ The m mountainous part of it was mount Macvar, and
Gedor,” διο. “ The plain of it was Heshbon, with all its
cities, which are in the plain, Dibon, and Bamoth-Baal, and
Beth-Baal-Meon ¹¹,” διο. “ The valley of it is Beth-Haran‚
and Beth-Nimrah, and Succoth,’' Sto.

The mention of the mountains of Macvar occurs in that
hyperbolical tradition of R. Eleazar Ben Diglai, saying ⁰,
“ The goats *5³:72 ’ἾΠΠ in tho mountains os Maovar sneezed
at the smell of the perfume of the incense in the Temple.”
The word Macherus is derived from ἾἸὈῺ Mac-var.

The whole country, indeed, which was beyond Jordan,
was called Perea: but it was so divided, that the southern
part of it was particularly called Perea ; the other part was
called Batanea‚ Auranitis, Trachonitis. So it is called

Περαία, καὶ Γαλιλαία, “ Perea and Galilee came into the pos-
session of Herod Antipas: and Βαταναία τε, καὶ Τράχων, καὶ
Αὖρανίτις, Batanea, and Trachon, and Auranitis, into that of
Philip.”

lm Bashan passed into Batanea, according to the Syriae
idiom‚ that changeth ’Φ (Shin) into Π (Thau) ε 1⁸:1¹1: Batanaia,
in the Samaritan interpretem ΓΞΠὉ Matanin, in the Tau-gum-
ists, by the alternate use of Β (Mem) and :2 (Beth), which is
not unusual with them.
