the dispute is, whether they were Levites or Israelites, par-
ticularly nativos of Emmaus, the natives of those two families,
who, for their purity, were thought wortby to be taken into
the affinity and blood of the priests themselves. And this
passage, indeed, puts it out· of all question, that Emmaus
was not within the tribe of Ephraim3 because it would be
ridiculous to suppose that either Samaritan women should
be joined in marriage with the priests, or that Samaritan
men should be permitted to play on the instruments in the
Temple. Emmaus, therefore, must be placed in the tribe of
Benjamin, which what it was called before is not easy to

gulsgonceive there ns mention made of this place 1n Siphrae:

“.ss Akibah said31asked Rabban Gamaliel and R. J oshua

ΦἸΝΌΝ *Ῥω Divum: in the shambles of Emmaus, when „they
went to receive the beast to make a feast for their son,' ’.διο

Now Rabban Gamaliel and R. J oshua were both of J abneh;
so that, by considering the situation of J abneh, we may more
confidently believe that they were in the Emmaus we are
speaking of. We have the same passage in Maccoth, fol.

It was one of the larger cities: for so J osephus speaks of
it3 Kazf τέσσαρας πόλεις ἐξαυδραποδίξεται Κάσσιος, ὧν ἦσαν αἱ

Θαμνά· “ Cassius disfranchized four cities, the greatest of
which was Gophna and Emmaus; and next to these was
Lydda and Thamna.'’

Unders the disposition of the duke of Palestine amongst
the rest, was “ Ala Antala of the dromedaries of Admatha ;''
where Pancirole notes, that Admatha in St. Jerome‚ in his
Hebrew Places, is called ‘ Ammata.’ This, by the agreeable-

. ness of sound‚ may seem to be our Emmau33 unlesS, more pro·

bably, at this time it bore the name of Nicopolis.

When Ι take notice that Chammatlt nnn or the ‘ Baths
of Tiberias,' are commonly in the Greek rendered Ἀμμαοῦς,
and withal, that our Emmaus was much celebrated for famous
waters3 Ι cannot forget the ‘ waters of Nephtoah‚' or the

‘Fountain of Etam,’ from whence water was conveyed by
