the event of that war, gave this town the name of Nicopolis.
Before the city 11661 1116 road (where our Saviour‚ after he
had arisen from the dead, walking with cleophas, made as if
he was hastening to another town), there is a certain medi-
cinal spring, wherein not only men that are sick, being
washed‚ are cured, but other sort of 6111111616 6166, of whatso-
ever diseases they are afflicted with. The report is, that
Christ, as 116 was once going that way with his disciples‚
turned aside 16 11161 fountain3 and having washed 1116 feet in
it, 1116 waters have ever 611166 retained¹ a healing quality and
virtue in them.'’

We leave 1116 credit of the story to the relater of it: only
6116 thing we may observe from the hint he gives ue, that it
16 116 wonder if, in the evangelist's time, Emmaus was but 6
111116 village, when as, 1161 long before it, it had been burnt
and destroyed by Varus ¹. Nor 16 11 111616 strange, that its
ancient name Emmaus should change into Nicopolis, when
the place itself became a Roman colonyr.

Snc‘r. IL—Its situation.

Prommr tells us something of its situation by its degrees‚
saying, “ Emmaus, 65. 45. 31· 453³
As to the vicinage of countries or places adjacent, thus
the Jerusalem Talmud ²: ἾΠ ΟἸᾺὮᾺ “vm ῘἸἾἹΓΙ ΠὉὉ stom
Beth- horon ιο Emmaus it a wey. :7¹70oe -1111 'un 6166613
From Emmaus to Qdda it is champaiyn,· and from Lydda to
the sea is valley.”
If you would hear Ptolemy more largely, thus he writes ε
Jamnia . 65. 40. 32. 0.
Lydda . . 66. 0. 32. 0.
Antipatris 66. 20. 32. 0.
Emmausa 65. 45. 31. 45.
Jerusalem 66. 0. 31. 40.
Although this account of the distance betwixt Jerusalem
aud Emmaus doth not very well agree with what our evan·
gelist and J osephus have said, yet may we 166111 from the
