Talmudists for the dates of palm-trees, that never come to
their full maturity: D'y‘ff ΠἾἾΌΠ ΓΟ Α sort qfillpalmva
as the Gloss in Beraeoth¹; “ the fruit os the palm that never
ripens.'’ So Arueh in mn: Caphnith. By a signification
near akin to '’N'' Hono, and *WWN Aheno, which denotes the
ann-ipo dates of palms3 from whenee‚ I suppose, Bdkwys 1¹¹
the mount os Olives, is derived. So that some out-,most part
of the city and wall towards mount -Olivet was called Beth-
phayo from the βψ that grew there, and another part of it
Ohapkeuatha from the dates.

Every'word almost in this place must be considered3 as,
indeed, almost every word of it is obscure.

I· ΟἹἿἹἹΖΟ Tauros :] This, indeed, is not so obscure, but
that every one knows mount Taurus, so noted by geogra-
phers and historiens, derived its name ἑμφατικοτέρως, more
emphatioally thence, since ἾἹἾῑΟ Taur both in the Chaldee
and Syriae signifies a mountain.

II. Dum& Umamae .·] Neither is this so very obscure,
but that all who have turned over the J ewish writings do
aeknowledge it to ·be the mountain run& Amana, and who
have turned over other books, Amanus. But in the mean
time, I doubt they, as well as myself, cannot tell why the
same Targumist should eall mount Hor, where Aaron died,
by the same name of marm& ῦἸἾἹἹἎ Taurus Umamoe,
