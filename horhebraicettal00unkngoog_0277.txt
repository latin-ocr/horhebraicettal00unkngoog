went to Palmyra of Syria 3 and of those who eame from

they with which we have to do.

What! ⁸2·oe hundred miles from Gaza to Petra, the metro·
polis os the Moabites3 1 wonder the very learned Heidmanb
should so softly swallow down these words, and that without
any regi-et. But let ine have leave to eonjeeture that Pliny,

· in his own copy, wrote thus, ‘⁸ It is distant from Gaza, a town

of our shore, OX.M :” but by the carelessness of the tran-
scribere, the numerioal letter X was eut into two parts, after
this manner, )(‚ and the left half of it, at length, olosed in
with the former O, in this manner ()‚ and so at last passed
into D; and the other right-hand half remained thus, O, and
was reekoned for a hundred.

However we may mistake in our eonjeeture, yet certainly
concerning the spaoe and numBer of the miles, we do not so
mistake. For allow thirty-eight miles, or thereabouts, be-
tween Petra and Asphaltites, and grant twenty miles, or
thereabouts, to the breadth of that sea (that we may go
something in the middle between Pliny and Josepbus eon-
eerning the breadth of it), then there will remain of the
hundred and ten miles whioh we suppose Pliny wrote, fifty-
two miles, or thereabout, from that sea to Gaza: which is
not far from the mark. But the mark is vastly overshot‚
when six hundred miles are assigned from Gaza to Petra.
You will surely favour our eomputation, and conjecture of
the injury done Pliny by the transcribere, when you shall
have observed, that the first shore of Gaza is, aecording to
Ptolemy, as we have said, in degr. 65. 263 and Petra is only
in degr. 66. 45.

Let us, therefore, grant fifty-two or fifty-three miles, or
thereabouts, for the breadth of the land from the shore of the
Mediterranean sea to the Asphaltites: you must allow some
more miles between the Mediterraneum shore and Jordan:
beoause by how mueh the more broad the Asphaltites is, so
much the less broad is the land; and the same must be said
of the sea of Gennesaret and Samoohonitis. And Galilee is
