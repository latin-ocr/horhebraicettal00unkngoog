particularly and diffusively, as some of the Jews please, it is
divided into seven parts; ι. :ww-r 2. 22] 3. 3⁷:³1³ 4. 0³

So that when the Holy Scripture divides the south of
Judea from Idumea, Num. xxxiv, and J osh. xv,-we must
know that dividing line now is broken, and all the south of
J udea is called Idumea. But here, by the way, I cannot but
note the Arabic interpreter, who renders Edam, in Josh. xv. ι,
by ow ‘aa Rome .·-by what authority let himselflook ιο it3
so let the Jews do too, who commonly call the ‘ Romans,’
‘ Edomites.’

How much this New Idumea shot itself into J udea is not
to be defined; since it admitted indeed no limits, but where
either the force or fraud of that nation could not thrust itself
in farther. If you betake yourself to J osephus‚ here and
there speaking of that nation, you would think that it ex-
tended almost as far as Hebron. Thence, perhaps, were
those endeavours of some, ofq freeing the hill-country of
J udea from tithing. of which endeavour we can searce con·
ceive another reason, than that that country was now too
much turned heathen‚ and tithes should not be taken from
heathens. For these Idumeans were but a remove from hea-
then : they had passed into the J ewish rites3 but they were
neither friends to the Jews nor to their religion.

Wmm 1 am thinking of this New Idumea‚ I have a suspi-
cion whether the ‘ third Palestine‚' which is also called ⁵ ‘ the
Healthful,’ may not be understood of this very part of Pales·
