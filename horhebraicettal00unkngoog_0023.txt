much dried in the summer-time, was grown over with thorus

well ιο the lake of Sirbon, joining the commentary of Dio-
dorus Siculus b. For he relates, that that lake, for the most
part, is so covered with sand, that it hath often deceived and
supplanted travellers‚ yea, whole armies, thinking it to be
firm land.

VI. nnbm Nn* We have nothing to say of this, besides
this observation,—that since it is also called by the same
Gemarists ΠἯῙἋΠἻ, the guttural Π seems to be melted into ’ς

Bar R. Abhu said, Seven hundred kinds of clean fish, and
eight hundred· kinds of clean locusts, and of birds an infinite
