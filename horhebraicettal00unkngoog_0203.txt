Of the places qs Burial. 193

[ver. 121, Peter ran to the sepulchre ¹¹, and, when he had
stooped down, he saw the linen-elothes ;” that is, the women,
and Peter after them, standing in the floor (ἾΒΠΞ), bow
down their faoeS, and look downward into the plaoe where
the sepulchres themselves were (ΓΣὉΠ mm& tho eave of tho
yram), which, as we said before, was four oubits deeper than
the floor.

John xx. 5: “ The disciple whom Jeeue loved earne first
to the sepulchre3 and when he had etooped down ” (stand-
ing in the floor, that he might look into the burying-plaoe)‚
“ saw the linen elothee lie3 yet went he not in. But Peter
went in,” ὅπως that ie, from the floor he went down into the
eave iteelf, where the rows qftho yram (1³:52) were (in which,
neverthelese, no eorpses had been as yet laid, besides the
body of J esus): thither aleo after Peter, John goes down.
And ver. 11 2 ‘⁴ But Μαι-γ, weeping, stood at the sepulchre
without: and while she wept‚ she stooped down to the se-
pulchre, and saw two angele in white sitting, one at the head,
and another at the feet, where the body of Christ had lain.”

“ She stood at the sepulohre without ;” that ie, within
the eave, on the floor‚ but without that deeper eave, where
the very graves were, or 1³:52 tlte placeo for tlte bodies .· bow-
ing herself, to look down thither, she saw two angele at the
head and foot of that Ὅ) ooffin wherein the body of Christ
had been laid.
