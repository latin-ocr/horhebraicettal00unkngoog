Reyion round about Jordan. 219

Μέγα πέδιον, Tho ‚areat plain, extended from the town Gin-
nabri into the Asphaltites: in length twelve hundred furlongs,
in breadth one hundred and twenty. Καὶ μέσον ὑπὸ τοῦ Ἰορ-
δάνου τέμνεται, and it is cut in tlte middle by Jordan.” The
plain of Jordan before the overthrow of Sodom, dvc. Gen. xix.
[2 5.] is περίχωρος, ‘ the country about it,' in the Seventy.

Thone words touch what is περίχωρος Ἰορδάνου, “ the
region about Jordan θ’ and the word πᾶσα, ‘ all,’ added by
the evangelist, may persuade us that the further side may
also be taken in, especially if it be considered how small a
distance the river made. The space was so little, that, as the
Gemarists relate, “ a ¹¹² fire kindled ou one side reached over
to the other.” And they suppose, water on this side might
be spirted to the other, in that cantion: ‘⁴ Let¹¹ no man take
the waters of purification and the ashes of purification, and
carry them beyond J ordan; nor let him stand on this side,
and spirt to the other.”

However, the river was not so broad, but that two, stand-
ing on each bank, might look upon one another, cast some-
thing over from the one side to the other, yea, and talk
together. And then think, whether the inhabitants of the
further side resorted not to the Baptist, being so near him,
and, as it were, within sight of him.

The masters disputo, whether Jordan be to be esteemed
as ‘ the bounds of the land of Israel,' or as · the laud itself ς’
and the occasion of that dispute ariseth from another ques-
tion, namely this: The flock of one man is separated and
divided into two parts, and those two parts seed in distant
places: it is asked, Whether tithe is to be taken as of one
flock, or two! Hence the discussion of the point glides to
J ordan; one part of the flock is on this side Jordan, the
other on the other. If Jordan be to be esteemed for ‘ the
bounds of the land,' then one part is within the land, the
other without. But if it be to be reputed for ‘ the land
itoelf: then the business is otherwise. Among other things
in this dispute‚
