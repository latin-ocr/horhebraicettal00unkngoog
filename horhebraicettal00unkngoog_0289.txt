Pharaoh, chap. xli. 123 and when he saith of himself, that
he was stolen away ‘⁸ out of the land of the Hebrews,'' Gen.
xl. 15‚—it is scarcely probable that that whole land was
known to other countries under that name, only for one
family now dwelling there; and that family a stranger‚ a
traveller, and living in danger from the inhabitants: but
rather that it was known by that name from ancient ages,
even before it was called “ The land of the Canaanites.”
Nor, if we‘should raise a contest against that opinion, which
asserts that the languagem of the Canaanites and the Hebrews
was one and the same, would that argument any whit move
us, that the towns and cities of the Canaanites bore names
which were also Hebrew; for those their H ebrew names
they might receive from Shem, Heber, and their children, be-
fore they were places of the Canaanites.

Heber lived when the tongues were confounded, and the
nations scattered3 and when none denied that the sons of
Heber were H ebrews, ( yea, who would deny that that land
was the land of Hebe‘r Ξ) by what reason should not they and
that nation take their name from him, after the same manner
as other nations took theirs from their father, at the confu-
sion of languages3
