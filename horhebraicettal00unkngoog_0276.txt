Thus the Latin version of him:

Oaesarea Stratonis ........... 66. 15.
J oppa ............... 6 5. 40.
J amnetorum portus. The haven of the J amnites . 6 5.

Gazaeorum portus. The haven of the Gazites . . 64 45.

Gaza ............... 6 5. 26.
And more of the like variation.

Of the last, namely, of ‘the haven of the Gazites,' and Gaza.
itself, we may justly be at some stand. In Ptolemy himself,
as you see, ⁴ the haven of the Gazites’ is in ξέ ς’ 6 5. 45.· But
the Latin interpreter hath 64. 45 :—nor indeed without reason,
when Gaza itself is only in 65. 26. But indeed, on the oon-
trary, it is more probable that the haven of the Gazites
should be plaoed in 6 5. 26, and Gaza itself in 65. 45; where,
by the ham is by no means to be understood that place
where shipsy put in and unladed‚ but the whole hay, eompre-
hended within the promontories that thrust themselves out
into the sea; the very last point of which thrusting forth
you may eonoeive to be in deg. 65. and 26: from the city
1 9 minutes.

If, therefore, you are minded to follow Ptolemy with this
amendment, in measuring out the breadth of the land be-
tween Gaza and Asphaltites, take it thus. Let Gaza be in2
deg. 6 5. 45. And in him also, Ἀσφαλτίτιδος τὸ μέσον ἐπέχει
μοίρας 85' ν’. The Latin version is, ‘⁶ Asphaltitis medium
eontinet gradus 66. 50. The middle of Asphaltites contains
degrees 66. 50.” From Gaza, therefore, to the middle os the
Dead sea, will be a whole degree and ἐστ minutes,· to which
65 miles, 5 minutos, do answer: whence if you withdraw the
half of the Asphaltites, there will romain 65 miles, or there-
abouts, from the shore of it to Gaza.
