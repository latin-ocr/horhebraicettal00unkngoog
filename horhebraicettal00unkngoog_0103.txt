Nob. Baburim. 93

Saul. This signifieth Saura-hill, which is distant from J eru-
salem about thirty furlongs.” Hence you may guess at the
distance of Rama from Jerusalem. J osephus calls the neigh-
bouring place of Gibeah, Ἀκανθῶν αὐλῶνα· “ the long Valley
‘ of Thorns :⁹⁹ perhaps, the valley under the rock Seneh [0729] .-

of which mention is made, 1 Sam. xiv. 4.

G H A P. XLIV.⁸
Nob. Bakurim.

Tmu- Nob was placed in the land of Benjamin‚ not far
from Jerusalem, whence Jerusalem also might be seen‚—the
words of the Chaldee paraphrast, upon Isa. x. 32, do argue.
For so he speaks; ‘⁶ Sennacherib came and stood in Nob, a
city of the priests, before the walls of J erusalem3 and said
to his army, ⁴ Is not this the city of Jerusalem, against which
Ι have raised my whole army, and have subdued all the pro-
vinces of it? Is it not small and weak in comparison of all
the fortifications of the Gentiles, which 1 have subdued by
the valour of my hand 3⁹ He stood nodding with his head
against it, and wagging his hand up and down,” ἔξω. Where
Kimchi thus; “Jerusalem might be seen from Nob. Which
when he saw from thence, he wagged his hand, as a man is
wont to do, when he despiseth any thing‚” Sto. And Jarchi
thus; ‘⁴ When he stood at Nob, he saw J erusalem,” Suc.

The Talmudistsb do concur also in the same sense with
the Chaldee paraphrast, and in his very words; adding this
moreover,—that all those places, which are numbe1·ed·up by
Isaiah in the place alleged, were travelled through by the
enemy with his army in one day.

The tabernacle sometime resided at Nob, when that was
destroyed, it was translated to Gibeon. “ And the days of
Nob and Gibeon'' (they are the words of Maimonidesc) “ were
seven-and-fisty years.”

We meet with mention of Bahurim, 2 Sam. xvi. 5. It
was a Levitical city, the same with Almon, Josh. xxi. 18;
which is also called Alemeth, 1 Chron. vi. 60. Those words,
“ And David came to Bahurim,'' in the place alleged in the
