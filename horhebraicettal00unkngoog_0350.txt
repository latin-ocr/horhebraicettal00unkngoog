worthy our observation with respect to heresies of this kind.
Should this capernaum be the same (as probably it is) with
that Gapernaum which we meet with so frequently in the
evangeliste, it is something observable what is said of it,

“ Thou, Oapernaum, which art exalted unto heaven, shalt be
brought down to hell.''

Snc'r. V.—Some skort remarks upon Cana, John ii. 2.

11- is very disputable which should be the first letter of the
word Cana, whether [2] Caph or [p] Koph, for we find both.

I. ΠΣΡ Hamil, with the initial letter Koph [Ρ], is a city in
the tribe of Asher‚ J osh. xix. 283 where the Greek for Kanak,
have Καυθάυ· and MS. Alex. Κανά.

ΙΙ. Ἶᾪ Kone, a word not very much differing in the souud,
occurs amongst the Talmudists ¹, ³2³3) ¹727 um '¹2⁸7 ,ΠὫῚ ἾΞἿ
ῚΠἹἾΠΤΔἸ “¹ ‘⁶ Rabbi and his Sanhedrim‚ having numbered
votes, pronounced Keni, clean.”-—Gloss ε “ Keni was a place
of doubtful esteom, reckoned amongst the unclean” [that is,
a place os the Gentiles]; “ but in the days of R. J udah Hac·
codesh, it came under trial, and they pronounced it clean.”

111. We find Κανὰ κώμη in Josephus‚ but the situation
not mentioned: Antiochusn being slain'' [viz. when he fought
with the Arabian kingJ, τὸ στράτευμα φεύγει εἷς Κανὰ κόμην,
“ his army fied to the town Kana.” This is hardly our Cana,
as may in some measure appear in J osephus’s context. ,

IV. But further he speaks in ‘ His Own Life 0,’ of κώμη τῆς
Γαλιλαίας ἢ προσαγορεύεται Κανά· “ Cana in Galilee.’' As for
its situation, as far as can be collected from J oscphus‚ we
discuss that in another treatise‚ and shew that it is not far
from that place where the river Jordan dischargeth itself
into the sea of Gennesaret; so that between this Cana and
Capernaum‚ there seems to be almost the whole length of
that sea.

V. But it must not be forgotten that ΓΠ) Canah, begin·
ning with the letter Caph, is met with in Juchasin 1²3 the
words these: Ε”ῙἋΠΞΠ ΠΝ ἾΞῚΦΠ “ In the end of the chap-
