Ἔνθεν τε πάλιν ἐκκλίνον πρὸς ἀνατολὴν ἐπὶ τὴν Σολομῶνος
κολυμβήθραν· “ Tlae wall aym’n inclined eadward, even to
Solomon's fieb-pond, and going on to the plaee called ophel,
it came over-against the eastern poreh of the Temple.” From
whenee we may gether that Solomon's fish-pool was within,
hard by the east wall of the city, and on this side the plaee
they called Ophel: which does so well agree with the situa-
tion of Bethesda within the sheep-gnte, that it seems to me
beyond all doubt or question, that Solomon’s pool aud the
pool of Bethesda were one and the same.

ΒΥ another stream the waters of Siloam are derived into
another pool‚ which is called the Lower Pool‚ Isa. xxii. 9,
and the King's Pool‚ Neh. ii. ¹4· near the west wall of Sion.

We have the mention of it also in Neh. iii. 15. 1-1)Ἵέ
'abbo—l ΡΒ ΠΙ2Φζῖ the pool os Siloam by the kiny’s ρανᾶση.
Where we may observe that it is here written HS& Saetaba,

different from ΠἸΒΨ Shzloalzla‚1sa. viii. 6; by a *differenoe

hardly visible 111 Biblos not pointed. indeed, sometimes over-
looked by myself, and 80, as is evident, by others. For Ἴῖβω
is rendered in the very same sound with saiwam, in the
complutensium, Vulgar, English, and Freneh Biblos. And,
in St. John ix. 7, where there is mention of the pool Siloam,
some commentators refer you to that text in Nehemiah.

The Greek interpretem did, indeed, observo the differenee,
and thus render the words of Nehemiah, Κολυμβήθρας τῶν
κωδίων τῇ κουρᾷ τοῦ βασιλέως· “ The pool of skins by the
king's wool ΒΡ Nor doth the Italian over-look 11; for that
renders it thus: ‘⁶ La Piseinu di Selae presso al orto del Re :³⁹
“ The Fish-pond of Selae hard by the garden of the king.”

It is observable in the Greek version, that whereas they
render the word by τῇ κουρᾷ τοῦ βασιλέως, the kiny’ s wool,

or hair, they may seem to have read '52 (ι fhoca qf wool

for l? a qarden. And whereas they translate 15³7& ΓῸἾΞ,
by κολυμβήθρα τῶν κωδίων, the pool of skins, they follow the
signification os the word as it is frequently used amongst the

Talmudists.
