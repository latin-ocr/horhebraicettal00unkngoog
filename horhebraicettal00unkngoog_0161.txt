Gadara. 151

⁴⁴ Β. Samuel ¹¹ Bar Nathan, in the name of Β. Chama Bar
Ohaninah, said, I and my father went up to Chammath of
Gadara, and they set before us small eggs.’'

“ Β. J onathan ¹ and R. J udah Nasi went *¹7:17 &nnn ²⁰
Chammatk qs Gadara.”

“ R. Immair and Β. Judan Nasi'’ [he was grandson of
Β. J udah N asi] “ went to Chammath os Gadara.'’

of the warm baths of Tiberias the Talmudists speak much.
Let these few things be collected out of them :—

“ Β. J osna² Ben Levi being sick, wasloed sometime in tlte
warm batha qs Tiberias, (14³5sz ΓῦῚὉΨτ Fra-12 *nom lean-
ing on the shoulders of Β. Chajia Bar Ba?

“ Three⁸ warm baths remained from the waters of the de-
luge.” 1. ἾἺΖΠ mlv: the whirlpool qs Gadara .· that pool
of Gadara, it may be, is that, which being drank of, as
Strabo b relateS, cattle lose their hair, horne, and hoofs. II.
1:5⁸2 *nnn mut, tlte ,ποατ fowntain qs Biram. Of Biram,
see Bab. Rosh hashanah‚ fol. 23. 2. the first line. ΙΙΙ. ἹὉΠ
testum, tho warm bathe qs Tiberias.

ι κῆιιο *nm mm ’το 1³¹7 wrm “ Theyo allowed them
the waters of Meara and the warm baths of Tiberias.’'

So also Josephusd: “ John (os Giscala) writ to me, praying
Χρῆσασθαι τοῖς ἐν Τιβεριάδι θερμοῖς ὕδασι, ‘ that Ῑ would permit
him the use of the warm baths which are at Tiberias.'’'

And so Pliny before: “ Tiberiade, aquis calidis salubri ;'’
‘⁴ Tiberias, healthful for its warm waters.”
