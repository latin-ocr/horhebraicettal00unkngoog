Double Rolnam. 21

Kedesh, whither they came the fortieth year, there was no
water, Num. xx, &o.-I answer, They drank, when they first
came to Kadesh-barnea, of the rook, which followed them
(ι Oor. x. 2), which dried up, when they were now ready to
enter into the land. If you ask, Why had those rivers that
followed them, dried up, as soon as they came at Kadesh-
bernes, which before had not dried up when they came
thither 3—then Ι ask also, Why had they dried up, when
they came to another Kadesh?

IV. Concerning the Kadesh, whither they came the last
year of their travel, it is said, that the city was in the utmost
bounds of the land of Edem τ and therefore, they desire leave
of the king to pass through the land of Edem, Num. xx. 16,
1 7.—-I answer, Nothing at all hinders, but these things may
be spoke of Kadesh-barnea, which lying contiguous to the
mountain of the Ammites, that is, to mountainous «ludes,
shewed so great an army an aocess, and promised it; only
that access was winding, and very difficult to be passed.
They desire, therefore, a more level way of the king of Edom,
but obtain it not.

V. Perhaps ² that which chiefly moved them, was this;
that supposing one Kadesh only, to wit, Barnea,--it will be
scarce possible not to confound the encampings of Israel in
the wilderness‚ and their movings from place to place—I
answer, There will be the same easiness of ordering them, if
you do but reduce the sixth and seventh verses of Deut. x,
into a true sense, and into agreement with Num. xxxiii. from
ver. 31 to 41 ; which is not hard to do. But let these things
suffice, for the present, to have spoke besides our scope.
'rhat that Kadesh, to which they came in the fortieth year
(which is called Meribah, Num. xx. 13), is the same with
Kadesh-barnea, is clear enough from hence,—that Meribah
in Kadesh is assigned for the southern border of the land,
Ezek. xlvii. 193 which border of old was Kadesh-barnea,

Num. xxxiv. 4, Josh. xv. 3.
