Hans, concerning the chambers, they differ. 'Phe tract
Middoth assigns these to the south side3 “ The Y chamber of
wood‚ the chamber of the spring water, the chamber Ga-
zith.'’—The Babylonian Gremars,² and Maimonides⁸ assign
them to the north side. In Middoth‚ “ the chamber of salt,
the chamber of Happarva„ the chamber of them that wash,”
were on the north side: in those, they are said to be on the
south. The matter is hardly of so great moment, that we
should weary ourselves in deciding this controversy. We
enter not into disputes, but follow those things that are more
probable, the Middoth being our guido.

Ι. Therel'ore we suppose, first, that the chamber Gazith
was on the south side ol' the court, near the east corner: and
that upon this reason‚—that since, according ιο all the Jews
(howsoever differing on what side it was placed), this cham-
ber was not in the middle of the three chambers before
named, but on the outside, either on the one hand or on the
other,-the council could not sit in the lot of J udah, if Gazith
were not seated about that place which we assign. ⁸

Chol} for “ none might sit in the court, unless kings only
of the stock of David.”

“ Ine the chamber Gazith sat the council of Israel, and
judged concerning the priests. Whosoever was found touched
with any spot was clothed in black, and was veiled in black,
