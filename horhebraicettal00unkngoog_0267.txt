under the second Temple its holiness ceased. They sow it,
therefore, the seventh year; aud they appoint thence the
first tithe‚ and t-he poor's tithe the seventh year, for the main-
tenance of the poor; who have not a corner of the field left,
nor a gleaning that year: thither therefore the poor betake
themselves, and have there a corner left, and a gleaning‚ and
the poor's tithe.”

We produce this, for the sake of that story which relates

true which obtains among the Jews, that the destruction of
Jerusalem was nwfflm ‘ in the seventh year,’ which was
the year os release, when on this side Jordan they neither
ploughed nor sowed, but beyond Jordan there was a harvest,
and a tithing for the poor, διας hence one may fetch a more
probable reason of that story than the historiens themselves
give3 namely, that those poor Christiane resorted thither for
food and sustenenoe, when husbandry had ceased that year in
J udea and Galilee. But we admire the story, rather than
acquiesce in this reason.

Jerusalem Talmudists fix and rank these three under the
same condition with it, in those words which were alleged
before, Caphar Carnaim excepted‚ of which afterward.

Caphar Amas‚· which one would wonder at. But this is not
so strange to the Chaldee and Syriae dialect, with which it is
very usual to change 23 (Tsade) into y (Ain). So that the
Rabbin in the pronouncing of this word 0037 Amas, plays the
Syrian in the first letter, and the Grecian in the last, ending
the word in D (Samech) for Π (Cheth).
