 

Com-t ον’ the Gentiles. 65

Gamaliel³‚ walking in the C‘ourt οῖ’ the Gentiles (ῙἾἾΞΠ nrm),
saw a heathen woman, and blessed concerning her.”

And ¹¹ those that were exeommunicated and lamented.
“Alll that entered into the mount of th'e Temple, enter the
right-'hand way, and go about: but they go out the left-hand
way: except him, to whom any accident happens: for he
goes about to the left hand. To him that aske, ‘What is the
matter with you, that you go about to the left hand3—he
answerS, ‘Because I lament: ’ and he replies to him, ‘ He
that dwells in this temple comfort thee.’ Or, ‘ Because I am
excommunicated ε’ and to him he replies, ‘ He that dwells

in this house, put it into their heart to receive thee.' ”

And not seldom those that are unclean. Yea, he that
carries away the scape-goat might enter into the very court,
although he were then unclean. “ Ism he polluted, who is
to take away the goat? He entereth unclean even into the
court, and takes him away.''

“ 'rhen greatest space of the Gourt of the Gentiles was on
the south3 the next to it, on the east; the third, on the
north; but the least space was on the west. Of that place,
where the space was greater, the use was greater also.’'

In ⁰ the wall compassing this space were five gates: and
within, joining to the wall, were ἹἾΔΟ 10 0³:07 wat>
“ double galleries” or “ halls,” which yielded delightful walks‚
and defence also from rains.

There Ρ was only one gate eastward, and that was called,
the Gate of Shushan3 because the figure of Shushan, the
metropolis of Persia, was engraven in it, in q token of sub·
jection. In* this gate sat a council of three and twenty.
At the gate, on both sides, were nun shops ,· and the whole
gallery-walk, on this east side, was called “ Solomon's porch.”

On the south were two gates, both called the Gate of
Huldah: of the reason of the name we are not solicitous.
These looked towards Jerusalem, or Aera. The hall or
gallery‚ gracing this south side, was called ⁸ Στοὰ Βασιλικὴ,
