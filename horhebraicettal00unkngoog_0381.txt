ΠἾἸΒ “ Because upon that gnte was engraven the figure of
Shushan, the metropolis of Persia.”

It is no wonder if they eherished the memory of Shushan
and the Persian empire, because it was under that empire
that the Temple was built3 nor had they, indeed, ever re-
ceived much damage thence. But it is something strange,
that that sculpture should romain after so long a time that
· that kingdom had been abolished; and, after them, first
the Greeks, then the Romans, had obtained the universal
monarchy.

“ Upon ⁸ this gate the priest looked when he burnt the
red heifer.” For, slaying the heifer upon the mount of
Olives direetly before the Temple when he sprinkled the
blood, he looked towards the holy of holies t, The Gate of
Shushan, therefore, was not of height equal with the others,
but built something lower, that it might not hinder his
prospectu.

Upon this gate was the assembly os the Twenty-three held.
“ There¹ were three assemblies3 one upon the Gate os the
mountain of the Temple” [that is, upon the Gnte Shushan]:
“ another upon the Gate of the Gourt'' [that is, upon the
Gate of Nicanor] : “ a third, in the room Gazith?

Going into the court by the Gate Shushan, both on the
right hand and on the left, there was a portico, upheld by a
‚double row of pillars, that made a double piazza. And either
within or about that portico were the mm tabmae, or
shops, where salt, and oil, and frankinoense, with other ne-
cessary materiale for the altar, were sold ; but by what right,
upon such sacred ground let the buyer or the seller, or both,
