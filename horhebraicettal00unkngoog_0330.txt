remembrance of the sun's miraculous standing still by his
word. This is like them. Nor, indeed, is that of a much
better mould‚ which the Seventy add, ἐκεῖ ἔθηκαν μετ’ av'-
τοῦ εἰς τὸ μνῆμα, Sto. ‘⁴ There they put into the monument
with him the stone-knives, with which he circumcised the
children of Israel in Gilgal, when he brought them out of
Egypt, as the Lord had commanded them.” Were these,
think you, in the Hebrew text once, and have they slipped
out since? Do they not rather savour of the Samaritan
Gloss, or the J ewish tradition?

They recede from the Hebrew text in the same story, but

something mors tolerably, when they render &3233 Ἶῦῖἳ Tlffim
“ on the north side of the hill Gaash,'' Ἀπὸ Βορρᾶ τοῦ ὄρους

part from mount Gilead? I am not ignorant what some do
allego towards the untying this knot, viz. that it should be
taken thus, ‘⁶ Whoever be of mount Gilead, let them return.'’
'Phe Targumist to this sense ; “ Whosoever is fearful, let him
return, -γῃῖπγ &aaron amu-m and let choico bo made out of
mount Gilead3 i. e. ‘ Let the Gileadites be chosen.’ But
whether his meaning was that the Gileadites should be chosen
to remain because they are not afraid, or be chosen to re-
turn because they were; Ι shall not reckon it worth the while
to inquire.

But may not mount Gilead in this place be understood
of the hill Gaashss It is certain the situation agrees well
enough3 and perhaps there is no great difference in the
name.

Whence that mount Gilead beyond Jordan first had its
name, is not unknown; namely, from that lzeap of dom,
