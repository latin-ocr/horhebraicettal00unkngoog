The court imas. 73

GHAP. XXXIII.
The Oourt itoegf.

“The floorp of the whole sacred earth was not level, but
rising: when any went on, from the east gato of the Court of
the Gentiles, to the farthest part os the obet, —he went all m
a level. From the clad, he went up into the Court of the
women, twelve steps,--whereof every step was half a cubit
in height. Along the whole Oourt of the Women he went
in a leve13 and thence went up into the Oourt of Israel fif-
teen steps, every step half a cubit in height-..³³

Theq Oourt of Israel was a hundred and thirty-five cubits
in length, eleven in breadth.

Through all this court one went in a leve13 and thence
went up into the Court of the Priests by one step of a cubit
high: on which was set a pulpit (where the choir of the Le-
vites that sang stood), and in it were three steps, each half
a cubit. Therefore‚ the Court of the Priests is found to be
two cubits and a half higher than the court of Israel.

The ¹ Oourt of the Priests was a hundred thirty-five cubits
in length, eleven m breadth. And they divided the heads of
the beams between the court of Israel and the Court of the
Priests.

They went through the Gourt of the Priests' ιιι a level· ς
and the same they did along the space by the altar, and
along the space between the altar and the Pronaon‚ or the
‘ Porch of the Temple.’ Thither they ascended by twelve steps,
each half a cubit high. The floor of the Pronaon and the
Temple was all level: and was higher than the floor of the east
gate of the Gourt of the Gentiles, two and twenty cubits.

The length of the whole court was a hundred eighty-seven
cubits, that is, from east to west. To wit,
