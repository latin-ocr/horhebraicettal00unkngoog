region of the sea: for then, under that name, would be
included all the neighbouring places, and which are, as it
were, swallowed up by the land. They say, therefore, that
the more remote places are called, 0³07 ruffi-m ‘ The region
of the sea.‘ But neither does this please me: sor there is no
need of so great a distance, to make any place to be called,
‘ The region of the sea,' ao. But it is spoken in relation to
the western coast of the land of Israel; on which side there
are no [hoamen] cities near, and swallowed up by the land.
But the sea sets the bounds; but it doth not set the bounds
on other sides, &a The sense, therefore, of R. Solomon,
when he saith, ‘that- every region, without the land, is the
region of the sea,' comes to this,—That every region, which is
like to that region, is so called.''

Heathen cities were on that western coast; but seeing
they lay within the ancient bounds of the land, namely, the
‘ lip os the Mediterranean sea,’-they could not so properly

narrower limite than that, not only by reason Samaria was
rejected and shut out,—but also, because certain portions
were cut off (and they neither a few nor small), which became
the possessions of those, that went up out of Egypt; but,
under the second Temple, had passed into the possessione of
the heathen.

Now they were, upon this account, the more exact in
observing their bounds, distinguishing this land by known
bounds, both from all others, and, in some places, as it were,
from itself3 because they decreed, that very many mysteries
