“ Kitron· (J udg. i. 29, 30) is Tsippor: and why is it called
ἾἸΞΒ Tsippor ἓ Because it is seated upon a mountain 5503:
as Tsippor‚ a bird.”

“ Sixteen⁸ miles on all sides from Tsippor was a land flow-
ing with milk and honey.”

This city is noted in J osephus for its warlike affairs3 but
most noted in the Talmudists for the university fixed there,
and for the learning, whieh Rabbi J udah the Holy brought
hither, as we have said before. Heb sat in this place seven-
teen years, and used most frequently to say this of himself,
“Jaeob lived in Egypt seventeen years, and Judah lived in
Tsippor seventeen years.'’

Hec sat also in Beth-Shaarim, as also in Tiberias, but he

“ Thed men of Tsippor said, Whosoever shall tell us that

tables.' They said to him, ‘ Is Rabbi dead 3’ He said, ‘ Ye

the space of three miles. Β. N aohman in the name of R. Mena
said, ‘ Miraoles were done on that day.' When all oities were
gathered together to lament him, and that on the eve of the
sabbath, the day did not waste, until every one vvas gone
home, had filled 'a bottle with water, and had lighted up a
sabbath-oandle. The Bath Kol pronounoed blessedness upon
those that lamented him, excepting only one; who knowing
himself exeepted, threw himself headlong from the roos, and
died.

“ R. Judahe died in Tsippor‚ but his burial was in Beth-

through whiehf ye shall pass, but in the great,''' Sto. What
