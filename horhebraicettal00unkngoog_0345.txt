Immediately the holy blessed God procured five angels, in
the likeness of men, who offer him for five shillings to con-
vey the stone into Jerusalem, if himself would but give his
helping hand. He gave them a lift3 and of a sudden they
all stood in J erusalem3 and when he would have given them
the reward they bargained for, his workmen were gone and
vanished. This wonder he relatos before the Sanhedrim, in
the conclave of Gazith. 'l'hey say to him, ‘ Rabbi, it should
seem that these were angels that brought this stone ε’ so he
gave the elders the money, for which the angels had bar-
gained with him.'’

In truth‚ I should easilier incline to believe this story than
that of Loretto, because there is some reason to apprehend
this R.Ohanina no other than Haninah Ben Busa, a notorious
magician‘. Unless you will also say, that the chapel at Lo·
retto took that jaunt by the help of magio.

A ⁰ huge stone of its own accord takes a skip from the
land of Israel, and stops up the mouth of the den in Babylon,
where Daniel and the lions lay. But so much for tales.

Sao-r. 11.—Tlae situation ffNmretk.

Tun situation of Nazareth, according to Borchard, Brei-
denbach‚ and Saligniac, ought to be measured and deter-
miued from mount Thabor. For so they unanimously: ‘⁶ A
Nazareth duabus leucis contra orientem est mons Thabor :”
“ From Nazareth two leagues eastward is mount Thabor.’'
Nor is there any cause why, with respect to that region of
Galilee in which they place this city, we should dissent from
them, seeing there are others of the same opinion. Now the
mount Tabor was in the very confines that divided Issachar
from Zebulun; Josh. xix. 22, “ And the coast [i. e. of Issa-
clmr] reacheth to Tabor and Shahazimah.” But what coast
should this be? north or south? The north coast, saith
Josephus ¹ :—
