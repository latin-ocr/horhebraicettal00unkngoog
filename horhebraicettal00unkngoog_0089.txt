Synaqoyuee and εοΙιοοῑε. ⁸ 79

in Pesikta: R. Menahem, from R. Hoshaia, saith, Four hun-
dred and eighty synagogues were in Jerusalem, according to
the arithmetioal value of the word Ἰ &fimf Note, that the
letter Ν is not computed. [n=40. =30. 55:400. ³:10]

:rmnmn'm ‘7127 nm: “ The synagogue of the Alexan-
drians,'’ is mentioned by the Talmudists: ooneerning which
also the Holy Scripture speaks, Acts vi. 9.

“ Eleazart Ben R. Zadok received (sor a price) the syna-
gogue of the Alexandriana, and did his necessary works in it.
The Alexandrians had built it at their own charge.’' This
story is reoited by the Babylonian Talmudists, and they for
Alexandrians have nunnus Tho Braziers. For so they ¹¹
write: “ The¹ synagogue of the Braziers, whieh was at
Jerusalem, they themselves sold to R. Eleazar,’' διο. The
Gloss rendere :nonus ‘by ΠΨἹΠ) ’ΞἾἸΒ ‘ workmen in brass.’
-The reason why the Alexandr-iaus were so ealled, you may
fetoh‚ perhap8‚ from this story z “ There Υ was a brass eymbal
in the Temple; and there being a oraok in it, the wise men
brought artifioers from Alexandria to mend it, &a There
was also a brass mortar in the Temple, in which they beat
their spiees3 and there being a eraek in it, the wise men
brought artifioers in brass from Alexandria to mend it,” διο.

Consider well, what *mito Diffi) “ The language of Tursi,'’
means in that legend. “ Bigthanz and Teresh ΒἾὍἾἸῙΩ 'zm
ἸῚΠ (perhaps) were two Tarsians :’' or, if you will, ‘ two arti-
fioers ε’ “ and they talked together ὊἾῚῙΩ pvb: in the lan-
guage os Tursi'' (where the Gloss, ‘ Tursi is the name of a
plaee') 3 ‘⁴ and they knew not that Mordeeai was one of the
elders in the ohamber Gazith‚ and that he understood seventy
languages,” διο.

In ⁸ the plaee noted in the margin, these words are related
eonoerning the sending away the goat Azazel‚ or the scape-
goat: “ The chief priests permitted not an Israelite to lead
away the scapo-goat into the wilderness: but once, one Ar-
sela, who was an Israelite, led him away : and they made him
a sootstool because of the Babylonians, who used to pull off
his hair, and to say,- Take it, and go.'' The Gemara thus3
