The mountain of the Amorites took its beginning from
Cadesh-barnee, the southern border, of the land of Israel,—
and, by a hardened gibbosity, thrust forward itself into J udea
beyond Hebron, the name only being changed into the “ Hill-
country of J udea.” Whence is that of Samson to be under·
stood, that he carried not the gates of Gaza near to Hebron,
or to the mountain, whence Hebron might be seen 3—-.but to
the top of this mountainous country, which runs out to
Hebron z—and so are the words to be rendered, J ud. xvi. 3,
“ He carried them to the top of a mountainous place, which is
before Hebron.”

This mountainous country is called Βῆζῐ ⁸5:31·sp ‚ “ The
mountainous desert,” Psal. lxxv. 6, because it is not from the

'rhat is, as it seems, potter's clay: for the Gemarists, speaking
somewhere concerning potters, say, “ thatt they work in black
dust, or in white dust.”

“ Inu the days of· R. Hoshaia, some went about to get a
freedom from some tithes for the Mount of the King.''

Rabbi Simeonx had vine-dressers ἾιὶῃΠ ἾΠἎ in the Mount
of the King. He was minded to let out his vineyard to
heathens.

R. Chaijah5‚ R.1ssai, and R. Immai‚ went up to the King’s
Mountain. They saw a certain heathen, who was suspicions
concerning their wine.

A2 myriad of cit-ies stood in the Mountain-royal, of which
R. Eliezer Ben Harsum possessed a thousand.'’ This moun-
