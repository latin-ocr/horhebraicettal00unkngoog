Miscellaneam matters. 187

3. 0³50: Villaycc. That ie, such where there was not
a synagogae. Yea, saith the Piske Harosh‚ ‘⁴ a fortified
town, wherein are not ten men of leisure” (or such aa ‘ceased
from the things of the world ς’ and these made up a syna-
gogue), *1022 ΓΠ) “ is reputed as a village,” dvc.

‚ That which ie added in the text of the Misna„ ‘⁶ Unlesa
the villages do anticipato it to the day of the congregation‚’'
is thus explained by the Glossem: “ When tow-me, girt with
walls, read the Book of Esther on the fisteenth day, and
those that were not walled, on the fourteenth (see Esth. ix.
21): and yet it ie said before’' (in the same text of the
Minna), “ that that book is read the eleventh, twelfth‚ and
thirteenth days3 the wiso men granted liberty to the vil-
lages to preoccupate the reading, namely, on that day wherein
they resorted to the synagogae: that is, either the second
day of the week, that went before the fourteenth day of the
month, or the fifthf day of the week: which were days of
aesemhly, in which the villages resorted into the citiee to
judgment. For the second and fifth days of the week, the
judiciary consistories sat in the cities by the appointment of
Ezra. Now the villagere were not skilful in reading; there-
fore it was needful that they should have some reader in
the city.”

ΙΙ. Let the canons and cautione of the spaoes and places
next joining to the city or town be observed ε

doveoote was not built within fifty cubito from the city :” and
that, lest the pigeons might do injury to the gardens that
were sown.

2. nna 'rm *mm ιη phibin na wrm-2 “They per.
mitted not a tree within five-and·twenty cubita from the
city.” “ And this (as the Gloss speaks) for the grace of the
city?

3· mn '2 wo ιο :einp rm na ppwrnn “ They al-
lowed not a barn-floor wit-hin fifty cubita from the city :”
that, when they fanned their corn, their chaff might not
offend the citizens.

4. “ They permitted not dead carcases, or burying-places,
nor a tanner’s shop, to be within fifty cubita from the city”
