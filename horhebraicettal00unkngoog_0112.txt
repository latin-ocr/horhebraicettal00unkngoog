They}² believe, also, that the bulk of the host took up the
same space, while they passed Jordan. Nor is it unfit so to
believe: for it, indeed. seems at least to have taken up a very
large spaoe in its passage: this especially being observed,
that, while the ark stood in the middle of Jordan, none might
come within two thousand oubits near it, J osh. iii. 4. When.
therefore, it is said, “ that the people passed over against
J ordan,” it is to be understood of the middle of the host‚—or
of those that carried the ark, and of those that went next
aster the ark.

Fromq Abel to Jordan, were sixty furlongs (seyen miles
and a half). The breadth of Jordan from bank to bank was
but of a moderate spaee. The Jerusalem Talmudistsr do
write thus of it, in some part of it: “A fire sometime passed
over J ordan'' (that is, a flame kindled on this bank flew over
to that). “ But how far is the flames carried? R. Eleazar
saith, For the most part to sixteen eubits; but when the
wind drives it, to thirty.—R. Judah saith, To thirty oubits3
and, when the wind drives it, to fifty.—R. Akibah saith, To
fifty eubits ; and when the wind blows, to a hundred.’'

Fromt Jordan to Grilgal were fifty furlongs (six miles and a
quattor). Therefore the whole journey os that day, from
Abel to Gilgal, was fourteen miles, or thereabouts. The
Talmudists‚ being deceived by the ambiguity of the word

³72¹„ GilyaL extend it to sixtyu miles, and more: whom see

afterward quoted in the eighty-eighth chapter. Itis thus
said in Midras Tillin, “¹Saul went, in one day, threesoore
miles.''

Of the stones, set up by Joshua in Jordan and Gilgal, the
Gemaristsy have these words :r—“ R. J udah saith, Aba Cha-
laphta‚ and R. Eleazar Ben Mathia, and Chaninah Ben Cha-
kinai‚ stood upon those stones, and reekoned them to weigh
sorty sata eaeh.''
