on the north3 and the other sities stood in this order: from
Lasha, southward, Zeboim3 after it, Admah; ast-er it, Go-
morrah3 and after it, on the utmost southern coast, Sodom.

111. The Asphaltites, saith Josephus ω, is extended in
length, Μέχρι Ζοάρων τῆς Ἀραβίας, “ unto Zoar of Arabia 3⁹⁹
and, Deut. xxxiv· 3, Moses, from mount Nebo, beheld Zoar
from the utmost bounds of the land on that side, as he had
behold the utmost bounds of it from other sides.

IV. En·gedi is Hazezon-tamar; so the Targum of Onkelos
in Gen. xiv. 7: see 2 Obron. xx. ας and Tamar was the
utmost south berder: Ezek. xlvii. 193 ΠἫἿὉΠ *u ΓΞ) ¹¹·

V. ‘⁶ The berder of J udea (saith Solinus ⁰) was the eastle
Masada. And that not far from Asphaltites ι).”

J osephus <³ indeed saith, that this eastle was οὔ πόρρω
Ἱεροσολύμων, “ not far from Jerusalem ;'’ which seems to
thwart me in placing it as 1 have done. But, besides that
we might eontend about that reading, when it is very usual
with historians to use the words οὗ πόρρω, and ἐγγὺς, ‘ not
far offi’ and ‘ near‚' in a very wide and loose sense,--one

lirrhoe is a fountain very near Jerusalem ;'' when yet how
far off was it! And in Strabo ⁸, Lecheus is λιμὴν τῆς Ἰταλίας
ἔγγὺς, “ a port near Italy ;” when yet it was distant many
hundreds of miles.

Masada in Hebrew is rrum Masadah, which implies t
fortification: and that wit-h good reason, when that sastle was
fortified even to a mit-asle. The name is taken from ι Sam.

“ in Maserem” (otherwise Μασερὲθ, Maur-eth), ἐν τοῖς στέ-

Mam-oth,- as though they had read in the original tunm:
