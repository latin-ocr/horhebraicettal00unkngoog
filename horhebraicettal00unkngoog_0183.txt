that they may fix Gilgal near Gerizim and Ebal; where they
think the people encamped the first night after their entrance
into the land of Oanaan, from those words of Moses, Dent.
xxvii. 2, “ In the day, wherein thou shalt pass over Jordan,
thou shalt set thee up great stenes, and shalt plaster them
with plantor? διο. Now those stones, say they, are set up
in Gerizim and Ebal. Hence is that of the Gemarists ¹¹, “ The
Lord said, Ι said, When ye shall pass Jordan, ye shall set up
stones3 butx you have spread yourselves as far as sixty miles.”
And Y, “ Gerizim and Ebal were sixty miles distant from
J ordan.’'

But certainly by that Gilgal, of which Mosesssin those words
speaks, “ Are not Gerizim and Ebal ’Ἰξιῖξὶζῐ &RD over-ayaimt

Gilyal ?” is to be understood some other than that which
Joshua named by that name, Josh. v. 9. For when Moses
spoke those words, the name of that Gilga1, near J ericho, was
not at all: nor can that which is spoke in the book of J oshua
concerning Ε’ξὶιξλὲ ῠῗῆἒ tho natione of aitqaue, J osh. xii. 23, be
applied to that Gilgal, when it had obtained that name.
Therefore, in both places, by Gilyal seems to be understood
Galilee; and that as well from the nearness of the words‚—for

’τέρα Gilqal, and ¹⁷⁸5? aaliz, are of the same root and ety-
mology,—as from the very sense of the places. For when, in
, ὖοεὴιιει, some kings of certain particular cities in Galilee—
Kedesh‚ J okneam‚ Dor, &c.—are reckoned up, the king of
the natione of Gilgal, or Galilee Ζ, is also added, who ruled
over many cities and countries in Galilee.

So also the words of Moses may very well be rendered in
the like sense, ‘ Are not those mount-ains, Gerizim and Ebal,
beyond Jordan, over-against Gilgal, or Galilee 3'

These things following strengthen our conjecture z—I. The
