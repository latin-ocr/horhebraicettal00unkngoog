Τθιηρίθ, making up the breachee3 and, ae Middoth in the·
place above speaks, “ 'Phoco thirteen breachez, which the

The altar, because it had been profaned by Gentile ωσι-ᾖ·
ficee, they pull it wholly down, and lay up the stenes iu a
coetain chamber near the court.

‘⁶ Towards⁸ the north-east there was a certain chambel-
where the sons of the Aemoneans laid up the stones of that
altor, which the Grecian kinge had profaned :’' and that
(as the Book of the Maccabeos hath it) μέχρι ταῦ παραγενη-
θῆιάι προφήτην, τοῦ ἀποκριθῆναι περὶ αὗτῶυε “ till there might
come a prophet that should direct them what to do with
them.''

Nor did it seem without reason : for, whereas those stonee
had once been consecrated, they would by no means put them
to any common use ; and since they had been profaned, they
duret not put them to any holy use.

The rest of the Temple they restored, pur-god, περαίνω,
ae may be seen in the places above quoted; and, eal-,hofm-
and-twentieth of the month Oisleu, they celebrated the feast
of the Dedication, and established it for an anniversary eo-
lemnity, to be kept eight days together. Of the rites of that
feast 1 shall say more in its proper place; and, for the sake
of it, Ι have been the larger in these things.
