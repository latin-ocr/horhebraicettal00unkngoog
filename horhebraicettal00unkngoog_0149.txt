Pameas. Paneas. 139

the mean time, the fountain of Great Jordan to lie hid, not to
be spoken of, and to be buried iu eternal obscurity. What !
is the kas worthy of so mueh fam03 and the gyratam, of none
at all! Let us have liberty to speak sreely what we think,
with the leave of chorographers.

Ι. It does not appear that any other river of Jordan flows
into the lake Samoehonitis beside that which arisoth from
Paneas. In what author will you find the least sign of sueh
a river? But only that such a conjecture erept into the mapa,
and into the minds of rnen, out of the before alleged words of
J osephus, misoonoeived.

II. We think, therefore, that Jordan is called the Greater
and the Less, not upon any aeeount of two sountains, or two
rivers, different and distant from one another; but upon ao-
oount of the distinet greatness of the same river. Jordan,
rising out of Paneas, was called Littlex, until it flowed into
the lake Samoehonitis; but asten-ward coming out of that
lake, when it had obtained a great increase from that lake,
it was thenoeforth called Jordan the Greater. Samoohonitis
received Little Jordan, and sent forth the Great. For sinee
both that lake and the oountry adjacent was very fenny, as
appears out of J osephus,—the lake was not so mueh in-
oreased by Jordan flowing into it, as it increased Jordan
flowing out of it. Κόπτειῖ τὰ τῆς Σεμεχωνίτιδος λίμνης ἕλη τε
καὶ τέλματα· “Moors and fenny plaoes possess the parts about
the lake Samoohonitis.’' The river, therefore, below Samo-
ohonitis seems to be oalled ‘ Jordan ;' above Samoohonitis,
⁴ Little J ordan.'

Caesarea Philippi was built at Paneas, the fountain of
Jordan: which let the maps observe that they plaee it not
too remote thence. Φίλιππος πρὸς ταῖς Ἰορδάνου πηγαῖς ἐν
Πανεάδι πόλιν κτίζει Καισάρειαν· “ Philip² built tho city Gae-
sarea in Paneas, at the springs of J ordan.'' And also, Πανεάδα
κατασκευάσας ὀνομάζει Καισάρειαν “ Havingu finished paneae,
he named it caesarea?
