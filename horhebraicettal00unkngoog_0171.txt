digested the Mishnaioth into one volume. '⁴ For when he
saw the captivity was prolonged” (they are the words of
Tsemach David, translated by Vorstius), “ and the scholare
to become faint-hearted, and the strength of wisdom and the
cabala to fail, and the oral law to be much diminished,—he
gathered and scraped up together all the deci-ees, statutes,
and sayings of the wise mem of which he wrote every one
apart‚ which the house os the Sanhedrim had taught, Sto.
And he disposed it into six classes; which are Zeraim, Moed,
Nezikin, Nashim, Kedoshim, Tahoroth.'' And a little after ς
“ ΑΗ the Israeliten ratified the body of Mishnaioth, and
obliged themselves to it: and in it, during the life of Rabbi‚
his two sons, Rabban Gamaliel and R. Simeon, employed
themselves, in the school of the land of Israel: and R. Chaija,
R. Hoshaia, R. Ohaninah, and R. John, and their companions.
And in the school of Babylon, Rabh and Samuel exercised
themselves in it,'' dvc.

Therefore it is worthy of examination, whence those differ-
ences should arise between the Jerusalem Misna, and the
Babyloniam — differences in words, without number, — in
things, in great number3 which he that compares them will
meet with every where. You have a remarkable example in
the very entrance¹¹¹ of the Jerusalem Misna, where the story
of R. Tarphon’s danger among thieves is wanting, which is in
that os Babylon.

Whether R. J udah composed that system in Tiberias or
in Zippor, we are not solicitous to inquiret he sat in both,
and enriched both with famed schools; and Tiberias was the
more eminent. For '5502 ‘mm ΠῙἋἾᾸ &Um-'2 m'ffl'·
“ The ¹ university of Tiberias was greater than that of
Zippor.'’
