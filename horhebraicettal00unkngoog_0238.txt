kings of Graeoia erected an idol: as it is said in the book
Avodah Zarah, In the corner looking north-east the Asmo-
neans hid the stones of the altar, which the Greeks had pro-
faned with their idols.'’

But whether these our interpreters suppose aad Javan to
be that chamber where those stones lay hid, laid up there
by the Asmoneans when they repaired the altar, concerning
which place see if you please the place in the margin03 or
whether they suppose it to be the place itself where the idol
stood, inquire. But how much space it was thence, and what
way they went from thence to Siloam, I heartily wish they
had told us. They say only thus much⁴ of that matter, that
“it was so much space as one might walk while a man twice
bathed‚ and twice dried himself.”

Being now in the Temple we cannot but take notice of
a name of it usual Ρ among the masters, namely, ΠἾἮ Bima,
that ie, as the Aruch explains it, a palaoe. “ Ifq a mis-
chance in the night [or a gonorrhoea] happened to any Levite
going forth.. mnu-1 nrm naban-1 nmen: ³¹> Ἶῑνιη 120
wem down into a secret walk which kd away under Birah, or
the sanctuary‚ to a bath? 8³0. These things are related of
the second Temple. But elsewhere, when it is disputed
‘ Whether men were better under the first Temple or the
second: Rabba determines it, &³:⁴5 &⁵mess mmm rw:

particular part of the Temple, they that lived after had that

of the discourse in the place quoted, it seems, that by rw:
Birak, Rabbah understood not the Temple itself‚ but the
glory of the Temple. and those divine endowments of it, “ The
heavenly fire, the ark, Urim‚'’ gno. which were present to the
first Temple, but absent from the second. For presently they
slip into discourse concerning the ceasing of prophecy under
the second Temple, and the Bath Kol's sueceeding in its

places. The word NTa is in David’s mouth, 1 Chron. xxix.
