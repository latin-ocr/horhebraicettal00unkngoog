years, returned to their own plaee.” Consider, that thirty
years passed from this aetion of Diocletian, which if you eom-
pute even from his first year, and suppose that this story was
writ in the last year of those thirty, you come as far as the
ninth or tenth year of Constantine.

Mention also of king Sapor occurs, if Ι do not fail of the
true reading. κώεα 37³7: κέντε aiam rmn *sm “A
serpentr, under Sapor the king, devoured oamels.'' Yea. I
have 1 know not what suspicion, that &³2:370 0525'395‘7 “ Luli-
anus the king,'' of whom there is mention in that very same
plaoe, does denote Julianus the emperor. ‘⁶ When Lulianus
the king (say they) came thither, a hundred and twenty
myriads aeoompanied him.” But enough of this.

There are some who believe the holy Bible was pointed
by the wiso men of Tiberias. I do not wonder at the impu·
denoe of the Jews, who invented the story; but I wonder at
the eredulity of christiam, who applaud it. Recollect, I
beseeoh you, the names of the Rabbins of Tiberias, from the
first situation of the university⁸ there, to the time that it
expired ε and what at length do you find, but a kind of men
mad with Pharisaism, bewitohing with traditions and be-
witohed3 blind, guileful, doting; they must pardon me, if I
say magieal and monstrous? Men, how unfit, how unable,
how foolish, for the undertakingt so divine a work! Read
over the Jerusalem Talmud‚ and see there how R. J udah, R.
Chaninah, R. J udan, R. Hoshaia, R. chaija Rubba, R. Chaija
' Bar Ba, R. J oehanan, R. J onathan, and the rest of the grand
doctors among the Rabbins of Tiberias, behave themselves !
how earnestly they do nothing! how ehildishly they handle
serious matters! how mueh of sophistry‚ froth, poison, smoke,
nothing at all, there is in their disputes! And if you ean
believe the Bible was pointed in sueh a school, believe also all
that the Talmudists write. The pointing of the Bible savours
of the work of the Holy Spirit, not the work of lost, blinded,
besotted, men.

R. J udah, who first removed the university to Tiberias, sat
also in Zippor for many years, and there died: so that in
both places were very famous sohools. He composed and
