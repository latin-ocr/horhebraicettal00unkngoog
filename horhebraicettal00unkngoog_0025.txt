Tho Sea ofs0d0m, rz‘mrv 1:³³.

The bounds of J udea, on both sides, are the sea; the
western bound is the Mediterranean,—the eastern, the Dead
sea, or the sea of Sodom. This the Jewish writers every
where eall ΠῙῚὮΠ 0⁸, 'which you may not so properly in-
terpret here, “ the salt sea,” as “the bitumineae sea.'' In
whieh sense num-'D Πῖἳῃ word for word, “ Sodom’s salt,''
but properly “ Sodom's bitumen,” doth very frequently oeeur
among them. The use of it was in the holy ineense. They
mingled ΠὍἹἿΟ n³m ‘ bitumenl,' ΓΠἾΠ ΠΕ) ‘ the amber
of Jordan: and 'ww filum, an herb known to few, with the
spiees that made that ineense.

Plinyo speaks thus os it: “In length it is more than a ι

hundred miles: in its greatest breadth, it makes five-and-
twenty,—in its least, six.” What agreement is there between
these two? I suppose J osephus does not eomprehend within
his measure the mque of the sea, of whieh mention is made,
J 0011. xv. 2.—and defines the breadth, as it was generally every
where diffused. Ooneerning its distance from Jerusalem,
Solinusv also speaks: “ In a long retreat from Jerusalem
(saith he) a sad bay openeth itself ς whieh that it was struek
from heaven, the ground, blaok and dissolved into ashes, testi-
fies. There were two towns there, one named Sodom, the
other (1001011110.υ But that distance was not direetly south-
ward, but by a very long deelination eastward.
