Tribes in Galilee. 129

the former not well,—the latter exceedjnglyt ill. Of it thus
writes the same J osephus, Zassovmvcmtu τὴν μέχρι Γεννησα-
ρίτιδος, καθήκουσαν δὲ περὶ Κάρμηλον καὶ θάλασσαν, ἔλαχον·
“The Zabulonites had for their portion the land unto Gen·
nesaret, extending unto Carmel and the sea. '’ Observing
that clause μέχρι Γεννησαρίτιδος, “ unto &aunem-et, '’ we
(persuaded also by th‘e Talmudioal writers, and led by reason)
do suppose the land of Zabulon to lie on the south shore
and coast of the sea of Gennesaret, and that whole sea to be
comprised within the land of Nephthali. With what argu-
ments, we are led we shew afterward, when we treat of that
sea. Which assertion‚ we know, is exposed, and lies open to
this objection :—

Object. J osephus saith, in the place but now quoted, that
τῆς Γαλιλαίας τὰ καθύπερθεν, ἕως τοῦ Λιβάνου ὄρους, καὶ τῶν
τοῦ Ἰορδάνου πηγῶν, “ the upper parts of Galilee unto mount
Libanus, and¹ the springs of J ordan‚” belonged to the por-
tion os Nephthali. But now if you stretch the portion of
Nephthali from the springs of Jordan to the utmost southern
coast of the sea of Gennesaret (which our opinion does),
alas, how much doth this exceed the proportion of the other
tribes! For from Scythopolis, the utmost south berder of
Galilee, to the south coast of the sea of Gennesaret, was not
above fifteen miles: within which space the whole breadth of
the two tribes of Issachar and Zabulon is contained. But
from the south coast of Gennesaret to the springs of Jordan,
were about forty miles ς which to assign to the land of N eph·
thali alone, is neither proportionable nor congruous.

Ans. This objection indeed would have some weight in it,
if the land of Nephthali did extend itself eastwardly as much
as the land of Issachar and Zabulon. For these run out as
far as the Mediterranean sea; but that hath the land of
Asher, and the jurisdiction of 'Pyre and Sidon lying between
it and the sea. So that when the breadth of those countries
is measured from south to north, the breadth of this is mea-
sured from east to west. ⁴ There is therefore no such great
inequality between these, when this is contained in the like
