II. When the prophet Ezekiel takes a prospeet of the new
Jerusalem in a vision,—he saith, that he stood upon “ a. very
high mountain, near which was, as it were, the building of
a city on the south‚” Ezek. xl. 2. On whieh plaee Kimohi

mountain was the Mount of the Temple: for the Temple was
to be built in a mountain, as before. And the city Jerusalem
is near it on the south? And Lyranus again, after the re-
eiting the explication of some upon that verse, and his re-

was, τῆς ἅνω ἀγορᾶς, the Upper Toum.
