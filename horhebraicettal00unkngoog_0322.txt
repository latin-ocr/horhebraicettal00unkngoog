812 Choromapkioal Notes.

The Persian interpreter, instead os Nain, hath olent-22
Nubelis, that is, Neapolis, which is also Sychem: but for
what reason, I know not. Nor do I suppose that it was con-
ceived by any one expositor, that the widow’s son, whom
Christ raised from death, was a Samaritam he was indeed

upon the borders of Samaria, but a great distance from
Sychar. ,

and the Rabbim.

Tan Darshanim [expositore] upon Bereshith Babba ‘¹¹ speak
of a certain place called ΟΨ) Ναὺη, upon this occasion ε
“ Issachar is a bony [or strong] ass, Gen. xlix. 14· It is
spoken os Issachar's country; for as an ass is low before and
behind, and high in the middle, so is it in the tribe of
Issachar; it is a valley here and a valley there, and hilly
otherwhere3 it couches between two borders. These are the
two valleyS‚ 3³:²00 nvp: the valley of Pislan, and the valley
of J ezreel. And he saw that rest was good, omn Ἱῖ this is
Tinaam .- and the land that it was pleasant, ΟΨ) 'st this is
Naim.’'

We have here, by the way, a taste of those allegorical and
sar-fetched ways of expounding the Scriptures, wherein these
egregious commentators do so much please and value them-
solves. , However, we are thus sar beholding to them, that
they have given us to understand that there was a Nain in
the tribe of Issachar, called so from the plemantness of its
situation (as indeed omn Tinaam bears the same derivation),
which we have some reason to judge was the same Nain with
ours in the evangelist, and that in J osephus.

“ It¹¹ was usual for the Galileans‚ coming up to the hely
city to the feasts, to take their journey through the Samari-
tans’ country, καὶ τότε καθ’ ὁδὸν αὐτοῖς κώμης τῆς Νᾶὶς λεγομένης’
“ And then their way lay through a town called Nais.’' 1
confess the Greek expressions are something perplexed3 but
it is no great matter. “ It happened that some of the Sama-
ritans and inhabitants of the great plain fought with them,
and killed a great number.”

You may think he repeats the very same story, though
