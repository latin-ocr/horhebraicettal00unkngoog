When you take a view of that famous sountain, as it is
described by J osephus‚ thence you understand what waters
of J ericho the Holy Ghost points out in Josh. xvi. 1.—-And
when you think of that most pleasant country watered from
thence let that Rabbinical story come into your mind, of
ἸΠἿἾἾ Φ ἹΠΦἹἺ Tho yzjft' qf fierit-ho, os five hundred cubits
square, granted to the sons of Hobab, Moses’s father-in·law:
of which see Baal Turim, upon Num. x. 29, and the Rabbins
upon J udg. i.

OH3AP. XLVII.
Jerioho itsolf.

Wn read, that this city was not only wasted by J oshua
with fire and swerd, but cursed alec. “ Gursed be he before
the Lord, who shall rise up and build that city J ericho‚'' J osh.
vi. 26. “ Nor was another city to be built (says the Tal-
mudists 5), which was to be called by the name of J ericho:
nor was J ericho itself to be built, although to be called by
another name.’' And yet I know not by what chance this
city crept out of dust and rubbish‚ lived again, and fiourished,
and became the second city to J erusalenr. The same per·
sons which were just now cited, suppose that the restorer of
it was Hiel, the son os J ehoshaphat, to wit, the same with
J echiel, 2 Chron. xxi. 2 ; “ Hiel (say they ²) was of J ehosha·
phat, and J ericho of Benjamin.” And that is a just scruple,

' which R. David⁸ objecta—how it came about, that the pious

king J ehoshaphat should suffer such a horrid thing to be
done within his kingdom? Much more, how this should have
been done by his son? Let them disputo the business3 we
hasten somewhere else.'

Thau, which ought not to be done,—being once done,
stands good. Hiel did a cursed thing in building J ericho:
yet Jericho was not to be cursed‚ being now built. A little
after its restoration, it was made noble by the schools of the
prophete, 2 Kings ii. 5 3 and it flourished with the rest of
the cities of J udea unto the destruction of the nation by the
Babylonians.
