«ΠἮΓῊ ‘Theym built a scot-causeway, or a foot-bridge, upheld
with arches, from the mount of the Temple to the mount of
Olives, upon which they led away the red cow (to bo barnad).
In like manner, such a foot-causeway they made, upon which
they led away the scape·goat: both were built at the charges
of the public treasure‚ which was in the Temple.'' 'Phe reason
of that curiosity concerning the red cow was this z-when the
ashes of that cow were especially purifying above all other
things (for they cleansed from the uncleanness contracted by
the touch of a dead person), they thought no cantion enough
to keep him safe from uncleannesS, who was to burn the
cow. When, therefore, there might be, perhaps, some sepul-
chres not seen, in the way he was to gc, whereby he might
be defiled, and so the whole action be rendered useless,—
they made him a path, at no small eost, all the way, upon
arches joining to one another, where it was not possible to
touch a place of burial. The like care and curiosity was used
in leading away the scape-goat.

The¹¹ sheaf of first-fruitso was reaped from the Ashes'-valley
of the brook Kedron. The first day? of the feast of the
Passover, certain persons, deputed from the Sanhedrim‚ went
forth into that valley, a great company attending them; and
very many out of the neighbouring towns flocked together,
that the thing might be done, a great multitude being pre·
sent. And the reason of the pomp was fetched thence,
because the Baithuseans, or Sadducees, did not think well of
doing that action on that day: therefore, that they might
cross that crossing opinion, they performed the business with
as much show as could be. “ When it was now even, he,
on whom the office of reaping laid, saith, ‘The sun is set ;’
and they answered, ‘ Well.'—‘ The sun is set ς’ and they
answered, ⁴ Well. '—‘ With this reaping-hook 3' and they
answered, ⁴ Well.'-·‘ With this reaping-hook ς’ and they
answered, ‘Well.’—‘ In this basket;' and they answered,
‘ Well. '-—-‘ In this basket, ·' and they answered, ‘ Well. '—
