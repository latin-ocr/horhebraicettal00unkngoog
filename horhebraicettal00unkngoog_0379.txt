Solomon's Porch. 369

two qaus osHuldah k. At which gates l rather admire than
believe or understand what I meet with concerning them;
“ Behold ¹, he stands behind our wall, that is, behind the west
wall of the Temple3 because the Holy Blessed One bath sworn
that it shall never be destroyed. ΓΠῙἊΠ *lym ww ἾὩΦῚ

were nocer to be destroyed till God shall renew them.''

What gate that of tho priest’s should be, Ι am absolutel
ignorant3 unless it should be that over which was n:
ward-n: “ the conclave of the βουλαπῶν, the coumdlorsf
where was the bench and the consistory of the priests.

But be it this, or be it that, how do these and the rest
agree with what J osephus relateth3

“ Caesar m commanded that the whole city and Temple
should be destroyed, saving only those towers which were
above the resta viz. Phasaelus, the Hippio, and Mariamne,
and the west wall. The wall, that it might be for the gar-
rison soldiers; the towerS, as s. testimony how large and how
fortified a city the Roman valour had subdued. Τὸν δ’ ἄλλον
ἅπαντα τῆς πόλεως περίβολον οὕτως ἐξωμάλισαν οἱ κατασκάπτον-
τες, ὣς μηδὲ πώποτ’ οἰκηθῆναι πίστιν ἂν ἔτι παρασχεῖν τοῖς προσ·-
emoven- “ But ns to all the rest of the city and its whole com-
pass, they so defaced and demolished it, that posterity or
strangers will hardly believe there was ever any inhabited
city there.'’ thich all agrees well enough with what we
frequently meet with in the Jewish writers; that Turnus
Rufus drew a plough over the city and Temple. He is called
in J osephus Terentius Rufus, Ἀρχων τῆς στρατιᾶς ¹¹.

Sscr. 11.—Solom0n’s Poroh ; which it was, and where.

Tanoucm the ‘ Gste of Huldah' you enter into the Gourt of
the Gentiles, and that under the Στοὰ Βασιλικὴ, the Kiny’s
Gallery; which, from the name itself and gallantness of the
structure, might seem worthy of such a founder as Solomon.
But this is not the pot-ch or gallery which we seek for, nor
had it the name os νομαί from king Solomon, but from king

Herod.
