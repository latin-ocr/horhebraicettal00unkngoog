Tiberias. 147

lon), they lament him there (at Tiberias) after this manner,
The hearse of a famous man deceased in Sheshach (Babylon):
whose name also is of note in Rakkath, is brought hither:
thus lament ye him,—O ye lovers of Israel, Ο citizens of Rak-
kath, come forth, and bewail the dead of Babylon! When
the soul of R. Zeira was at rest, thus one lamented him, The
land of Babylon conceived and brought- forth delights, the
land of Israel nourished them. Rakkath said, Woe to itself
because she lost the vessels of her delights. Therefore saith
Babba, Chammath is the same with the warin baths of Gadar,
and Rakkath is Tiberias.'' ,

This city touched on the sea, so that the sea served on one
side for a wall to it. Hence is that, in the place but now
cited3 “ Rabh Hezekiah read the Book of Esther in Tiberias,
on the fourteenth day (of the month Adar), and also on the
fifteenth day (see Esth. ix. 21), doubting whether it were
compassed wit-h walls from the days of J oshua, or not. But
who would doubt this of Tiberias? when it is written, ‘ And
the fenced cities were Ziddim, Zer, Chammath, Rakkath, and
Chinnereth! But it is clear to us that Rakkath is Tiberine.
The reason, therefore, why he doubted was this, because on
one side it was enclosed by the sea instead of a wall. But if
it were so, why did he doubt? Because, truly, it was no wall.

When the tradition is thus, nain ww &³75 mir-1 πῖ) nm&
2³20 A city which bath a wall 3, but not fonffled walls, the

oontiyaous homes aro sor such walls. ΠὉἾΠ ΝὛἾΞὯ ῙΔἾΞ
ΠΠῺἸΠ But Tiberias is eccoepted, which ΙιατῘι the sea for a wall.”
So also R. Simeon Ben J ochai, in the Jerusalem Gemara just
now alleged: ‘ Among the cities fortified with walls Tiberias
is excepted‚ as having the sea for a wall.’

What fortune this city underwent under the name Rak-
kath, remains unknown. Herod the tetrarch put the name
of Tiberias upon it, and built the city, for the sake and me-
mory of Tiberius Oaesar. The etymology of which place while
the Gemarists deduce elsewhere, namely, either from 2512

“ because it was Betiboralc, in the nevel, or middle,” &a they
seem rather to sport out of a luxuriant wit, than to be igno-
rant os the thing itself.
