ww· ‘ww‘ ‘⁶ Tho men ῳ( Jerioko are famed for six things
done by them: in three of which the chief council consented
to them, but in the other three they consented not.” Those
things, concerning which they opposed them not, were
these :—

1. nvn ¹7: &Sp-r pacm “They ingrafted, οι- sommi,
together, palm-trees every day. '⁹ Here is need of a long
commentary, aud they produce one, but very obscure. The
business of the men of J ericho was about palm-trees3 which
they either joined together, and mingled males with females,
or they ingrafted, or (as they commonly say) inoculated the
more tender sprouts of the branches into those, that were
older. So much indulgence was granted them by the wise
men concerning the time, wherein these things are done,
which, elsewhere, would scarely have been suffered; unless,
as it seems, the nature of the place, and of the groves of
palms, required it.

ΙΙ. mm ΠΝ ΓΣὋ “ They folded up the recitatione of
their phylacteries :³³ that is, either not speaking them out
distinctly; or omitting some doxologies or prayers3 or pro-
nouncing them with too shrill a voice. See the Gomara and
the Gloss.

111. mum ³:0³7 ptr-nai pwmp “They maped, and ga.
thered-in their sbeaves‚ before the sheaf [qs firstffruits] was
offered :⁹⁹ and this, partly, because of the too early ripeness
of their corn in that place; and, partly, because their corn

grew in a very low valley‚ and therefore it was not accounted
fit to be offered unto the Mincha‚ or daily sacrifice. See the
Gloss.

The three things, concerning which the wise men consented
not to them, were these :—

1. ΦἻΡΠ ‘vm mum ΓἽἿΠὮ Such fruits and branches,
also certain fruits of t-he sycamine-trees, which their fathers
had devoted to sacred uses‚—they alienated into common.

ΙΙ. ΠΞΦΞ :numm nnrm ΓῙὌἸΝ “ They ate, on the sab·
bath-day, under the tree, such fruits, as fell from the tree‚''
