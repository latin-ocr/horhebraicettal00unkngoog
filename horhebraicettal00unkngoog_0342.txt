332 okoroyraplaicac inquiry.

Jordan to that beyond, but those also of Samaria, and those
of the Lower Galilee, passed over here to Perea.

Here would I seek for J aeob's Bridge, where he passed
over “ Jordan with his staff‚” when he went into Mesopo-
tamia, and returned back with a family3 and not where it is
commonly now shewn. At least, the mention of Sueeoth,
Gen. xxxiii. 17, whieh had its situation on the bank of J or·
dan, exaetly opposite to Zartanah, a town near Beth-shean,
puts it out of all question that Jacob returned that way.
And, indeed, whether Seythopolis might not derive something

of its appellation from the word Suoootla [fl5DQ] ‚ I eannot
well tell: methinks the name of ‘ Scythians' hath some smaek
of sueh a kind of original, Σκύθαι, quasi Σύκκοθαι· for they

always dwelt, and removed from one place to another, in
‘m' snam. V.—Beth-barah,.1udg.vii. 24.

N arrum was this Beth-barah at any very great distanee
from this passage. For so we have it, J udg. vii. 24: ‘⁶ Gi-
deon sent messengers throughout all mount Ephraim, say-
ing, Oome down against the Midianites, and take before
them the waters unto Beth-harah and J ordan.'’ And this
they did.

It 0 is hard to say whether Kimehi with more reason said,
that ‘⁴ these waters were not the waters of Jordan ;'' or J ar-
ehi, more absurdly‚ that ‘⁶ they divided Syria from Canaan.”
There were, no doubt, some waters in the valley of J ezreel ε
for there the battle was,—at least, if that may be ealled a
battle, where there was not one sword unsheathed by the
oonqueror. See J udg. vi. 3 3.—When the Midianites fied,
Gideon summons the Ephraimites by messengers, 'that they
would take those waters beforehand, whieh the routed enemy
iu their ssight must necessarily pass through before. they
eould arrive at the bridge or serry over Jordan (spoken of
even now), that lay in their way home. When both armies
had pitehed the field, 'the Midianites lay on the north, to-
wards Galilee, and the Gideonites on the south, near mount
Ephraim, ehap. vii. 1. There was a river in the vale, (at
which waters, probably, Gideon distinguished betwixt his
followers, that lapped like a dog, and those that did not).
