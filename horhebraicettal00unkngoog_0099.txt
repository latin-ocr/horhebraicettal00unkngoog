Mount Oliva. 89

they cannot but believe some such thing of that mount. R.
Janna saith f, mam„ “ Tho Divino ε Majesty stood three years
and a half in mount Olivet, and preached‚ saying, ‘ Seek ye
the Lord, while he may be found3 call upon him, while he
is near.'''

And now let us from this mountain look back upon the
city. Imagine yourself sitting in that place, where the priest
stood, while he burnt the red cow, directly over against the
east gate of the Temple. Between the mount and the city
you might see a valley running between, compassing Sion
on the right hand, and Jerusalem on the left: the Gate of
Waters against you, leading to the Temple; on the left·
hand, Ophla and the Herse-gato. From thence, as we have
said, was the beginning of the valley of Hinnom, which, at
length, bowed towards the south side of the city. In that
place, near the wall, was the Fullers’ field3 which whether
it was so called from wood framed together, where sullers
dried their cloth; or ἀπὸ κναφέως μνήματος, ‘ from a fuller's
monument‚' of which Josephus b writes,-we do not dispute.

From the Horse-gate, westward, runs out the valley Ke-
dron, in which is a brock, whence the valley takes its name
—embracing Sion also on the north. and spreading abroad
itself in a more spacious breadth.

‘⁶ Belowi the city, there was a place” (we do not dare to
mark it out) “ which was called &xm Motza .- hither they
came down’' (in the feast of Tabernacles) “ and cropped off
thence long boughs of willow” (it may be, from the banks of
the brook Kedron); “ and, going away, placed them near
the sides os the altar,—bended after that manner, that their
heads might bow over the top of the altar‚” Sco.

It is no marvel, if there were a multitude of gardens
without the city, when there were none within. Among them
‘⁴ a.¹¹ garden of Jerusalem is famed, wherein fige grew, which
were sold for three or four assarii each: and yet neither the
Tmma, nor the Tenth‚ was ever taken of them.''
