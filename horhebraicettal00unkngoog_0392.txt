382 Jonatkau upon Numb. xxxiv. 8.

&58:7⁰ ἢν Tho alto-mats os Bala, are in the Gloss, *m
35:257 Tho she-yones os Lebanon. And &²582 ἿἹΠ, in the
Glosser, is, malm -mv A buu astabam. For aba: saith
he, “ signifies a qrove.”

Let me conclude the whole with a conjecture something
extravagant, which the mention of Lebanon gives rise t0. I
suspect our Europe did first derivo its name from oold ; as
that mountain did, from the snows. The Phoenicians, saiting
to Hercules 's Pillars (of which see the learned Bochart), had,
on their left hand, the land of ΕΠ Oltam, beat or bur-rainy, i. e.
Africa: on the right hand, the land of ’'TW'' Choreph, winter
or oold, especially compared with the other’s heat, from which
word Choreph, probably, our word Europe takes its original.
That very learned man derives it otherwise; and let him enjoy
his sense, whilst Ι beg leave to enjoy my conjecture.
