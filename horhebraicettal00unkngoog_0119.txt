Wn mean not here the land of Ephraim, but a certain
town in the confines of that land: of which you read 2 Chron.
xiii. ¹9³3 and of which the Talmudic writers speakb: “ What
is the best flour‚” to be offered in the Temple? ‘⁶ Michmas
and Mezoneehah obtain the first place for fine flour3 ΠἺὊΦ
ΠᾯΡΞΞ ΕἾἿἾΞὮ 017³? Ephraim in the valley obtains the next
place to them.” These words are not read the same way

Those of the Mishnaioth, in the eighth chapter, read, as we

raim is a city, of which it is thus written in the books of the
Chronicles, ⁶ And Abijah took 0³³· *my Ephraim? '⁹

The Gemarists read it after the same mannen ΒἫἾΞΏ

rmmlv ‘⁶ Jannes and Mambres said to Moses, Do you bring
straw into Ephraim 3” Which the Aruch reciting‚ adds these
words; ‘⁸ There was a city in the land of Israel, very fruit-
ful in bream-corn, called Ephraim ε when Moses therefore
came with his miracles,—Jannes and Mambres‚ who were
the chief of Pharaoh's magicians, said unto him, This is our
business, and we can do thus with our enchantments3 you
therefore are like one bringing straw into Ephraim, which 18
the city of broad-corn, and out of which 18 provision for many
places: therefore, how doth any carry in straw thither3” ao.
