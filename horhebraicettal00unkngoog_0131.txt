διο. There were houses joining to the haven, and they also
were of white stone, sm. Over against the haven's mouth
was the temple of Gaesar, situate upon a rising ground, excel-
lent both for the beauty and greatness of it-; and in it a large
statue of Oaesar, &c. The rest of the works, which he did
there, was an amphitheatro, a theatro, and a market, all
