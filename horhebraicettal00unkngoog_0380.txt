J osephus, in this inquiry of ours, will lead us elsewhere;
who thus tells us ⁰, Ἤδη δὲ τότε καὶ τὸ ἱερὸν ἐτετέλεστο, “ At
this time was the Temple finished'' [i. e. under Gessius Flo-
rus, the procurator of J udea about the eleventh or twelfth
year of Nero]; “ the people, therefore, seeing the workmen
were at leisure’' [the work of the Temple being now wholly
finished], “ being in number more than eighteen thousand,
importune the king” [Agrippa] τὴν ἀνατολικὴν στοὰν ἀνεγεῖραι,
66 that he would ropair the eastern porch.'’ Here are some
things not unworthy our observation3 partly, that the Temple
itself was not finished till this time ς and then, that the eastern
poreh was neither then finished, nor, indeed, was there any at
all; for Agrippa, consider-ing both how great a sum of money,
-and how long a space of time would be requisite for so great a
work, rejected their suit. Herod, as it should seem from Ρ
J esephus, finished the Temple, and the Pronaon, tho perch
before it, and the Στοὰν Βασιλικὴν, tho Royal Galla-y. But
what he finished further, about the courts and cloister-walks‚
it does not appear. It is manifest, indeed, that there was a
great <1 deal left unperfected by him; when the whole was
not finished till the very latter end of Nero’s reign, and
scarcely before that fatal war in which the Temple was burnt
and buried in its own ruins ε which observation will be of use
when we come to John ii. 20, “ Forty and six years was this
Temple in building.”

Josephus proceeds, as to the eastern gallery: Ἦν δὲ ἦ στοὰ
τοῦ μὲν· ἔξωθεν ἱεροῦ· Now that was the qallery οβ’ the outward
Temple, overlooking a deep valley, supported by walls of four
hundred cubits, made of great square stone, very white. the
length of each stone was twenty cubita, and the breadth six.

Ἔργον Σολομῶνος τοῦ Βασιλέως πρώτου δειμαμένου τὸ σύμπαν
ἱερόν·6 ‘The work of king Solomon, who first founded the whole
Temple.” There needs no commentary upon these words; the
ἀνατολικὴ στοὰ, the east yallery was first ἔργον Σολομῶνος.
Solomon's work .· which plainly points which and where was
Solomon’s Porch 3 namely, upon the outer wall of the Temple,
