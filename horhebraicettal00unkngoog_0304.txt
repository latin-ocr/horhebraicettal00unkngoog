N either, indeed, doth St. Luke say any thing of Perea,
even then when he mentions the tetrarchy of Herod Antipas,
under whose jurisdiction, J osephus tells us, were both Perea
and Galilee. Ἐγένετο δὲ ὑπὸ τούτῳ [Am-imp] ἥ ’ τε Περαία καὶ
Γαλιλαία. “ Perea‘l and Galilee were both under Antipas.''

Why J osephus should not mention Perea, when he is
speaking of the father's kingdom, or why St. Luke should
omit it, when he instanees the tetrarchy of the son, that being
so unquestionably within his jurisdiction, I confess is some-
thing strange to me; nor could I pass it without some
remark.

The same J osephus tells us this of the tetrarchy of Philip ε
Βαταναία τε καὶ Τράχων, 830. ‘⁶ Batanea θ, alsO, and Tracho-
nitis, Auranitis, and some parts of Zeno’s house, about J am-
nia, yielding the profits of one hundred talenta, were under
Philip's government.” And again, Τότε δὴ καὶ <bacmos τε·
aevu? τὸν βίον, εἰκοστῷ μὲν ἐνιαυτῷ τῆς Τιβερίου ἀρχῆς. “ 'Phenf
died Philip, in the twentieth year of the reign of Tiberius,
when he himself had governed for seven-and·thirty years
over Trachonitis, Gaulonitis, and the country of the Bata-
neans.” Here we see Auranitis is not mentioned, but Gau-
lonitis is; and in St. Luke, neither Batanea, nor Gaulonitis,
nor Auranitis; but, instead of them, Iturea. There is a
chronological difficultys in these words of J osephus, which
is not easily solved 3 but this is not the business of this
treatise.

It is hard to say whether this ervowos οἶκος, homo os
Zenon, have any relation with Zenodorus the robber. J ose-
phus, in the place above quoted b, mentions him, saying, that,
Augustus was the more willing to put Batanea, Trachonitis,
and Auranitis, under the government of Herod the Great,
that he might the more effectually suppress the thefts and
rapines committed by one Zenodorus and the Trachonites.
Strabo* also speaks of this Zenodorus, telling us, that “ there
were few robberies committed now; καταλυθέντων τῶν περὶ
Ζηνόδωρον τῶν λῃστῶν, tho robbers of Zenodom's party bein-9
out qffi”
