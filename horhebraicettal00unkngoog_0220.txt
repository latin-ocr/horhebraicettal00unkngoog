“ hot baths‚” and translates the word Ghnnmth into Greek
pronunciation; but he, whosoever was the first author of it,
had scarcely found that town of J udea odled Emmaus, written
by the Jews ΠὩΠ maumeth, but ont-zm? or D'lthN Am·
maus, very far from the signification of ‘ warm bathe!

To b this add also, that mention is made in the same No-
titia. os Galatia Salutaris, or the ‘ Healthful ;' and there is a

Beersheba.

‘⁶ The shield·bearing horse of Illyria, at Chennula,” or in
Carmel, where Nabal dwelt.

“The promoted horse, inhabitants at Zodeeath ;” which 1
suspect to be the cave of Zedekiah, concerning which the
Talmudists speak.

‘⁸ The javelin·bearing horse, inhabitants at Zoar.'’ But
let these things be left in suspense.

And now to return thither whence this whole disputo was
raised, when it is said by St.. Mark‚ that “a great multitude
followed J esus from Galilee and J udea, and Jerusalem, and
from Idumea, and from beyond Jordan ;” he retains the
known and common division of the land of Israel at that
