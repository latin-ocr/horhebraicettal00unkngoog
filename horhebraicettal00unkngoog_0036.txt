begins Phoenic-eff* The sum is two hundred and fifty-four
miles. He had named J oppa before, ‘ J oppa of the Phoe-
nicians.’ But now, supposing he makes J oppa the berder
of Palestine, and the beginning of Phoenice‚ there are from
Pelusium ιο J oppa, himself reckoning, almost a hundred miles
more than in Strabo. Nor is there any thing to answer from
the difference of the measure of Strabo’s furlongs, and Pliny's
miles. For they go by the same measure, themselves being
witnesses: for ιο Strabo, τὸ μίλιον daromam, “ Eightu
furlongs make a mile ;'’ and, ιο Pliny, “ A0 furlong makes a
hundred and twenty-five of our paces :’'—which comes ιο the
same thing.

We must therefore say, that by the ‘ end of Palestine, ' in
Plinyo, is properly signified the end of it, touching upon
Phoenicia properly so called 3—that is, upon the borders of
Tyre and Sidon. For when he calls J oppa, ‘⁴ J oppa of the
Phoenicians,”—he does not conclude J oppa within Phoenicia3
but because the sea, washing upon that shore of Palestine‚
was divided in common speech into the Phoenician and the
Egyptian sea (so Strabo before, “ Afterward J oppe; after
that, the shore of Egypt? διο.) ; and because the Phoenicians
were famous for navigation‚—he ascribed their name ιο
J oppa, a very eminent haven of that shore. But he stretched
the borders of Palestine a great way farther 3—namely‚ so far
till they meet with the borders of 'Pyre and Sidon. So far,
therefore, doth Pliny’s measure extend itself ; ιο wit,—that,
from Idumen, and the rising of the Sirbon lake, ιο the borders
of Tyre and Sidon, there be one hundred and eighty-nine
miles. The place that divided these meeting-bounds ιο the
-Jews, was Acon, or Ptolemais; which we shall note, when
we come thither z—but whether it was so to Pliny, remains
obscure. 'But it is a more probable opinion, that he computed
according ιο the vulgar and most known distinction.

Gulielmus Tyrius Ρ, measuring the borders of the 'Pyre of his
time southward, extends them ιο four or five miles: “ For it
is extended southward towards Ptolemais, as far as ιο that
place, which, at this day, is called ‘ the district of Soanda·
rion,’ which is four or five miles.” If, therefore, it should be
