St. Mattheus, ohap. xvii„ of the oolleetors of the Didraehm,

feast of the Passover was now past a great while ago. But
we go on.

“ He who went into the ohamber to empty the obest,
went not in with a folded garment, nor with shoes, nor with
sandals, nor with phylacteries, nor with charms,” διο. And
the reason was, that there might be no opportunity, and all

“Thei walks (saith he, speaking of that court), running along
between the gates, extended inwardly from the wall before
the treasuries, were borne up with fair and great oolumns.''
To this let us add the words of the evangelist John, viii. 20:
“ These words spake J esus ἐν τῷ γαζοφυλακίῳ, in tho trea-
sury .·”-—if it had been said, κατέναντι τοῦ γαζοφυλακίου, ovor-
