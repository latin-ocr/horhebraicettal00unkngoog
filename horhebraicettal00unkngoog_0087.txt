namely, that they might testify concerning the new moon:
“ and there the Sanhedrim took them into examination;
and delicious feasts were made ready for them there, that
they might the more willingly come thither for the sake
thereof.'’

VIII. Somei courts also were built upon a rock‚ under
which there was made a hollow, that by no means anys- se-
pulchre might be there. Hither they brought some teeming
women, that they might be delivered there, and might there
also bring up their children. And the reason of that cu-
riosity was, that those children, there born and brought up,
where they were so secure from being touched by a sepulchre,
might be clean without doubt, and fit to sprinkle, with puri-
fying water, such as were polluted with a dead carcass. The
children were shut up in those courts, until they became seven
or eight years old. (So R.. Solomon, who also cites Tosaph-
toth, where nevertheless it is, “ until they are eighteen years
of age.'') And when the sprinkling of any one is to be per-
formed, they are brought with the like care and curiosity to
the place, where the thing is to be done, riding upon oxen,
because their bellies, being so thick, might defend them the
more securely from the defflement of any sepulchre in the
way.

IX. There were not a few caves in the city, hollowed out
of the rock, which we observed concerning the hollowed floor
of the Temple. Into ¹¹ one of these Simon the tyrant¹ betook
himself with his accomplices, when he despaired of his af-
fairs. Of whom you have a memorable story in the place
quoted.

(is that were not the same with Bethesda,) there π’ was Στρου-
θίου κολυμβήθρα, “ the Sparrow-pool,” before Antonia3 and
κολυμβήθρα Ἀμύγδαλος, “ the Almond·pool,” on the north side
of the cit .
