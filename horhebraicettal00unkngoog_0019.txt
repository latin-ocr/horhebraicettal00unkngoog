first and last clause of this place quoted3 which may have
some tendency towards our entrance into our present busi-
ness. The rest (if there be any we can attain unto) we shall
handle in their proper places.

“ These (say they) are the bounds of the land os Israel,
which they possessed that came out of Babylon.’'

“vm ‘77:122 nn'tr! ΠΦἾΕ “ The division, or part, os the
walls of the tower Sid.” Nor dare Ι confidently to assert,
that this is spoken of the ‘ tower of Strat0‚' or ‘ Caesarea 3'
nor yet do I know to what it may more fitly be applied. We
observe in its place, that that tower is called* by the Tal-
mudists, ἾἾΠ ‘Tun “ The tower Sir :'' which, by how very
little a point it differs from this word, and how very apt it is
by want of care in writing to be confounded with it, the eye
of any reader is witness. It may happily confirm this con-
jecture, that '09 the name Aco⁰, so soon follows, 'VN-lnffiv

the mountains,’' and they will protect you from showers and
rain. Hence, therefore, it may be supposed, that the word ’Ῥω
doth denote some way at the foot of some mountainous place,
which was, as it were, the dividing line between the ⁶ land of
Israel‚' and ‘ without the land ;’ perhaps at the foot os mount

Carmel z--but we do not asser-t it: we had rather profess ’

silence or ignorance, than, by a light conjecture, either to
deceive others or be deceived ourselves.

These places, concerning which the Talmudists here treat„
are os a different condition from those, which were called
:⁸55 ΓὊἿἾὮ “ The region of the sea. '’ For those places
were certain towns, here and there, on this sea-coast, and
elsewhere; which were, indeed, inhabited by heathens, and
so could not properly be reckoned the ‘land of Israe13’ yet
they were such, as between which, and the outmost bounds
of the land, was again the land of Israel. But these places,
which we are now handling, are those, which were the utmost
bounds, and beyond which were no places at all, but what
