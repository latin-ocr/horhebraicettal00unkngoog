szn Ι read Pliny of the situation of this city, and com-
pare some things which are said by J osephus and the Tal-

. mudists with him, 1 cannot but be at a stand what to re-

solve upon here. Pliny speaks thusb of the situation of it:
‘⁴ The lake [of Genesar] is compassed round with pleasant
towns: on the east, Julias and Hipp0; on the south, Tari-
chea, by which name some call the lake als03 on the west,
Tiberias, healthful forits warm waters.”

Consulti the maps, and you see Tiberias in them seated, as
it were, in the middle shore of the sea of Gennesaret, equally
distant almost from the utmost south and north coasts of
that sea. Which seems well indeed to agree with Pliny, but
illy with J osephus and his countrymen.

Ῑ. Josephus asserts that Hippo (in Perea, i. e. the country
on the other side Jordan) is distant from Tiberias only thirty
furlongs. For speaking to one J ustus, a man of Tiberias,
thus he saith, ‘H δὲ σὴ πατρὶς, ῶΊοῦστε, κειμένη ἑν τῇ Γεννησα·
ρι’τιδι λίμνῃ, καὶ ἀπέχουσα μὲν Ἵππου στάδια τριάκοντα, 830.
“ Thyk native country, Ο J ustus, lying upon the lake of Gen-
nesaret, and distant from Hippo thirty furlongs‚'’ διο. The
same author asserts also (which we produced before), thatl
the breadth of the sea of Gennesaret was sorty furlongs.
Therefore, with what reason do the maps place the whole sea
of Gennesaret between Tiberias and Hippo! Read those
things in J osephus, look upon the maps, and judge.

ΙΙ. The same J osephus saith of the same J ustus, Ἐμπέ-
πρησι ὁ Ἰοῦστος τάς τε Γαδαρηνῶν καὶ Ἱππηνῶν κώμας· αἳ δὴ
μεθόριοι τῆς Τιβεριάδος, καὶ τῆς τῶν Σκυθοπολιτῶν γῆς ἐτύγ-
χανον κείμεναι. “ Justusm burnt the towns of those of Gadara
and Hippo. And the towns bordering upon Tiberias, and
the land of the Scythopolitans, were laid waste.” Note, how
the towns of those of Gadara and Hippo are called μεθόριοι,
“ towns bordering upon Tiberias ;'’ which certainly cannot
