Rephaim. 285

not whence the word Asia may more fitly be derived, than
from the memory os this gigantic rane, living almost in the
middle of Asia, and monstrous and astonishing above another
Asiatica. The LXX call them Τιτάνας, Titan-3, 2 Sam. v. 1 8, 22.
The word used by the Samaritam denotas Physioiam θ, and
so it is rendered by me in the Polyglott Bible‚ lately pub-
lished at London‚ Deut. ii, partly, that it might be rendered
word sor word, but especially, that it might be observed by
what sound, and in what kind os pronunciation he read the
word ΟἾᾺΞἾ Bepkaim. So the LXX render it ’lav-poi,
Phyeioiam, lea. xxvi. 14, διο.

⁰ [ From *8¹32- sanavit. In the same sense unu is used in Chnldee
and Syriae-J
