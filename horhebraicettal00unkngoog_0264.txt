one qs tho Decapolitan sities.

Tus 'Palmudists very frequently propound the particular
example of the city Beth-shean, which is also called Scytho-
polis, (see the Lxx in J udg. i. 27), and do always resolve it
to stand in a different condition from the ot-her cities of the
land of Israel.

“ Rsbbi ⁰ (say they) looseth Beth-shean‚ Rabbi looseth
caesarea, Rabbi looseth Beth Gubfin, Rabbi looseth Caphar
Tsemach from the Demai;'' that is, from the tithiug of thing-s
doubtful. J archi citing these words addeth these rumcoven
“ Ford all those places were like to Beth-sheau, which the
Israelites subdued coming up out of Egypt3 but they subdued
it not when they came out of Babylon.''

“ R.. Meire (say they) ate the leaves of herbs [not tethea]
in Beth-shean, and thencesorth Rabbi Meir loosed all Beth-
shean from tithing.’' Upon which story thus Jarehi agaim
“ R. Meri ate leaves -in Beth-shean not tithed‚ because tithing
is not used out of the land of Israel.'’ Note this well, 1 pmy3
that Beth-shean, which plainly was within the land of Israel,
yet is reckoued sor a city which is out of the land of Israel,
and for a heathen city: and the reason is given, because, al-
though it were within the land, and came into the possession
of t-he Israelites in the first conquest of it, yet it came not
into their possession in their second conquest, but was always
inhabited by heathens. The same, with good grounds, we
judge of the rest of the cities of Decapolis, which were indeed
within the limite os Israelitic land, but which the Syrians
or heathens had usurped, and until then possessed. After
weshave numbered some of those cities, the thing will appear
the more clearly.

But if you ask, by the way, who the inhabitants of Beth-
shean were when the Jews came up out of Babylon3 and
who would not, could not be subdued by the Jews, is a matter
of more obscure search: you would guess them to be Scy-
thians from the derivation of the word, and from the words
of Pliny: “ Scythopolis, heretofore Nysa, from Scythians
