CHAP. XXXII.
The Gates and Doors on tlte North Side.

Ι. Fater, we meet with the “ gatel and ohamher Nitsots 3⁹⁸
where the priests and Levites watehed. This was also called
“ the gate os a song.”

ΙΙ. The “ ohamber of them that wash” was „next to that:
and the “ ohamber of Happarva,'' joining to that. In that,
they washed the inwards of the sacrifices; in this, they salted
the skins of the sacrifices. Some ¹¹¹ believe one Parva, a
magicum, built. this chamber; others, that that magioian‚
Parva, made a secret hole in the wall of this ehamber, that
through that he might see what. was here done by the high·
priest: “ Forn in a covered place of this chamber there was
a bath for the great. priest„ in the day of expiation.''

ΙΙΙ. Thence was the ⁶ gato of offering‚’ or of ‘ Gorban ε’
this was also called ‘ the gato of the women.’ The reason
rendered of the former name ie, “ that by this gato they
brought in the Most Holy sacrifices, whioh were slain on the
north.” But the reason of the latter is more obscure: per-
haps before that gate the women delivered their sacrifices
into the hands of the priests.

IV. After that gato, westward, was the “ ohamber of
salt :¹⁵⁹ where⁰ salt, was laid up for the offerings.

V. Following that was tho “ gete Beth Mokadh‚” or the
“ gato of burning :⁹⁹ so called from a chamber adjoining‚
where a. fire continually burnt for the use of the priests.
This also was called the “ gato Corban :’' for, between this
and the gnte last named was the ohnmber, where the publio
treasure of the Temple was laid up. In ‘ Beth-Mokadh’ were

four chambers 2—1. 0⁸⁸3& ΠΞΦῙ) ‘ The chamber of lambe ι’
where they were kept for the use of the altar. 2. ‘ The

chamber of the show-broad? 3. The ehamher, where the
stones of the altar were laid up by the Asmoneans‚ when the
kings of Greeoe had profaned the altar. 4. The chamber,
whenoe they went down into the bath.
