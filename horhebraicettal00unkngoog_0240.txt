Herodotus*² goes forward; Ἀπὸ ταύτης (Καδύτιος) τὸ ἐμ·
πόρια τὰ ἐπὶ θαλάσσης μέχρι Ἰηνύσου πόλιός ἐστι τῆς Ἀραβίας.
ἀπὸ δὲ Ἰηνύσου αὖτις Συρίων μέχρι Σερβωνίδος λίμνης· “ From
Cadyfis, the sea mart towns as far as Jenysus, belong to
Arabim from Jenysus onward to the Serbon lake belong to
the Syrians.” Words obscure enough; especially which was
the city Jonysusrz the Talmudists² indeed mention ΦὊἾΨ
Jonmh among the towns whioh they say are ΟἹΠΠΞ in the
confine33 but the situation does not agree. But we will not
pursue the matter in this plaoe.

“ 'runa streete of Jerusalem were swept every day, ’⁹
m* ³722 mna& pum> tabum* *pm Hence, «ι The
moneys that were found in Jerusalem before those that
bought cattle are always tenths. The moneys found in the
mount of the Temple are ΓῙἋΠ prosam or common. In
Jerusalem on other days of the year they are eommon3 but
in the time of the seasts they are all tenths. But, saith Β.
Shemaia‚ Upon what reason is thisZ when the streete of J e-
rusalem are swept every day.’'

The Gloss writes thus; “ They are always tenths: both
in the time of the feasts‚ and in the time when there are no
feasts. But moneys found in the mount of the Temple were
common, even in the time of the feasts. For it is supposed,
those moneys fell from them [or wore lost]‚ in the mount of
the Temple3 and thereupon they are common. But why
were they tenths in Jerusalem in the time of the feast-,03 And
why is it not said, That they had fallen from them there be-

fore the feast, as we say of the mount of the Temple? Be- ι

cause the streete of Jerusalem were swept every day3 and if
moneys had been lost there before the feast, they who swept
the street had found them before. But the mount of the
Temple had no need to be swept every day: for dire and
dust remained not there; because the mount was shelving:
and moreover, it was not lawful for any to enter there with
his shoes, or with dust- on his feet.”
