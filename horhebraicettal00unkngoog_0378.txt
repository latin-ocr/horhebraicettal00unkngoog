the city ; and it is plain enough in Holy Writ that the aque-
duct into the ·sheep-pool was from the fountain of Siloam t
which also from that spring, from whence it was derived, is
called the ‘ Pool of Siloam ς’ and from him that· first made it,
the ‘ Pool of Solomon ;' and from the miraculous medicinal
virtue in it, ‘ the Pool of Bethesda.⁹

As to the Water-gate, we find it mentioned Neh. iii. 2'6,
situated on the east wall of the city3 called the ‘ water-gate'
because through that the waters flowed out of the Templez.
and perhaps those also out of Bethesda. For, whereas the
waters ran incessantly out of Etam into the Temple, and
those that wem more than needed flowed out of the Temple,
they all fell down into the valley that lay between the Temple
and Jerusalem, and emptied themselves by that gate which
bore the name of the ⁸ Water-gate’ upon that account. And
it is probable that the pool of Bethesda, which also had its
constant supply by the aqueduct from the spring of Siloam,
did also continually empty itself along the descent of the hill
Aera, through the same galae, and so into the brook Kedron.
