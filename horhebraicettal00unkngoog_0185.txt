Cana. 175

Tyrians, having got together considerable forces, invade
Giscala.” You can scarcely suppose that these Tyrians came
out of Tyre of Phoenicia, bnt from some other place of the
same name.

Upon that reasonzthatzvery manysstowns in the land of
Israel were called by the name of Rama, namely‚ because
they were seated in some hiqk place3 by the same reason

Ws have little to certify as to the situation of this place:
only we learn this of J osephus concerning Cana, that it was
