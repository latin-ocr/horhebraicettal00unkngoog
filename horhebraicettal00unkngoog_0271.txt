called by Mark Ἑλληνὶς Συροφοίνισσα, ‘ a Syrophoenioian
Greek‚’ whioh is without all serup103 but when she is called
Χαναναία, ‘ a Canaanitieh woman, '³ by Matthew, that in
somewhat obscure. If those things which in our animad-
versione upon Matthew we have said upon that plaoe do
not please any, let these things be added: 1. That Oanaan
and Phoenioia are sometimes convertible terme in the Seventy,
Joehua iv. 1, ια, διο. 2. If 1 should say that Ἑλληνὶς, a
Greek woman, and Χαναναία, a Gamanitieh woman, were
also convertible terms, perhaps it may be laughed at; but it
would not be so among the J ewa, who eall all men-servants
and women-servants, not of Hebrew blood, Canaanitee. It
is a common distinction, Ἥ “my α Hebron> emant, and
’33733 '7:29 a Oanaanito sermm,- and so in the feminine sex.
But now a Canaam'to urvant, say they, is a servant of any
nation besides the Hebrew nation. Imagine this woman
. to be euoh, and there is nothing obscure in her name: be·
oauee she was a servant-woman of a heathen etoek‚ and ·
thence commonly known among the Jews under the title
R'OEJD ΠΠΕΦ of a Gamanite woman-servant.
