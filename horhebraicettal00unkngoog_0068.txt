ἔπειτα πρὸς νότον ὑπὲρ τὴν Σιλωὰμ ἐπιστρέφον πηγὴν, διο.
“ And thence it bends to the south behind the fountain
Siloam.'' After the tumult raised at Jerusalem by the Jews
under Florus,—the Neapolitan tribune, coming thither with
king Agrippa, is besought by the Jews, σὺνἰ ἑνὶ θεράποντι
περιελθεῖν μέχρι τοῦ Σιλοᾶ τὴν πόλιν, “ that taking only one
servant, he would go about through the city as far as Siloam'’
(that is, from the east to the west, through the whole city) ε
and that thence, from the peaceable and quiet behaviour of
the people towards him, he might perceive‚ that the people
were not in a heat against all the Romans, but against
Florus only.

III. Siloam was on the back of Jerusalem, not of Sion.
Let that of J osephus be notedk3 Ῥωμαῖοι, τρεψάμενοι τοὺς
λῃστὰς, δια, “ The Romans, when they had drove out the
seditious from the Lower city, burnt it all to Siloam.” This
we therefore observe, because we may see some maps, which,
placing Siloam behind Sion, do deceive here, and are deceived:
when¹ in truth it ought to be placedm behind Aera. The
pool, indeed, of Siloam was behind some part of Sion, west-
ward3 but the fountain of Siloam was behind Aera.

IV. It emptied itself, by a double rivulet, into a double
pool, to wit, the upper and the lower, 2 Kings xviii. 17, Isa.
vii. 3. The lower was on the west, and is called ‘ The pool
of Siloam,’ John ix. 7, Neh. iii. 15. The upper, perhapS,
was that which is called by J osephus, ‘ the pool of Solomon,'
in the place lately quoted. “ And thence (saith he) the
outermost wall bends to the south behind the fountain of
Siloam: ἔνθέν τε πάλιν ἐκκλίνον πρὸς ἆνατολῆν ἐπὶ τὴν Σολο-
μῶνος κολυμβήθραν, 8ῦο. : and thence again bends to the east
at the pool of Solomon.'’ See 2 Chron. xxxii. 30. Isa. xxii.

that solemn festivity of the feast of Tabernacles, which they
called, ΟὮΠ ἹῚΟῚ) “ The pouring out of water :'’ concerning
