7716 city Otho. 259

Sscr. VI. 2-0oesarea Phihppi.

Tms city also is of the same rank with Beth-shean in the
Talmudists: and Ptolemy besides encourages us to number
it among the cities of Decapolis‚ who reckons it among the
cities of Midland Phoenicia3 and J osephus, wh0‚ in his own
Life, intimates Syrians to be its inhabitants. We correct here
that which elsewhere slipped us, namely‚ that the Arabio
interpreter, while he rendere Oaesarea for Hazor‚ J osh. xi. 1,
may be understood of ‘ Oaesarea of Strat0‚' when he seems
rather to respect this Caesarea.

And now, from what has been said, think with yourself,
reader, what is to be resolved concerning those words of
St. Mark, “ J esus went from the coasts of 'Pyre and Sidon
unto the sea of Galilee‚ through the midst of the coasts of
Decapolis :” think, Ι say, and judge‚ whether by the ‘ coasts
of Tyre and Sidon,' any place can be understood at the very
gates of Sidon; and not rather some place not very remote
from Oaesarea Philippi. And judge again, whether Deca-
polis ought to be placed within Galilee‚ and not rather (with
Pliny and Josephus) that a great part of it at least ought
not to be placed in the country beyond J ordan; and if any
part of it stood in Galilee, whether it ought not to be placed
in the utmost northern coast of it„ except only Scythopolis,
or Beth-shean.

Sncr. VIL— The city ἸΞἾὩ orbo.

ΒΥ occasion of the mention of Beth-chesn, Ι cannot but
subjoin the mention of the city ἹἎἾῺ from the words of R.
Judah‚ in the place at the margin 2-—“ R. Judah saith ³,

ΞᾞἿἿὩ the racem (or the peopls os Orbo) brought bread and
flach, inoming and ovening, to Elias. [1 Kings xvii. 6.] ww
ὉἾΏ mvl ῙΝΦ rw: D'ss'lffl ΝἸΠ ΤΙιαί city was in the bor·
ders qt‘Both-chean, and was called orbo.”

Some Jews raise a scruple whether ravens brought Elias
bread and flesh‚ or men called ΞᾞἾῇᾮ Ravens. So Kim-

chi upon the place: ‘⁴ There are some, wh0‚ by ΞἿᾏᾟΏ
understand marchana, according to that which is said, ³:125?
