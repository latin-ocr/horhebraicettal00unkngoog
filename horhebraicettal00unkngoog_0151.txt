Ἠιο Lake Semachonitis. 141

GH A P. LXIX. -
Tho lake Samoobonitss [or Semeclaonitis]

ΙΝ the Holy Soriptures it is the ‘ Water of Merom,’
J osh. xi. 5. In the Babylonian Talmudists it is ⁸:205 ΠΨ
‘ The Sibbeehean sea! Hence is that, “ J ordane ariseth out
os the eave of Paneas, and flows into the Sibbeohean sea.''
In the Jerusalem Talmudists‚ sometimes it is miz-¹ Nn*
‘ The sea of cubebo: as we have noted before; and sometimes
ὉΌΟἾ RD* ‘ The sea of Samaoo ;' whence in other languages
it is ‘ Semachonitis!

Τῇ f Σεμεχωνιτῶν λίμνῃ τριάκοντα μὲν εὖρος, ἑξήκοντα δὲ μῆκος
στάδια. Διατείνει δὲ αὐτῆς τὰ ἕλη μέχρι Δάφνης χωρίου· “ The
lake Semeohonitis is thirty furlongs in breadffi, and sixty in
length. The fens of it are stretehed out unto the eountry
Daphne; a country, as it is otherwise pleasant, so containing
fountains: οἳ, τρέφουσαι τὸν μικρὸν καλούμενον Ἰορδάνην ὑπὸ
τὸν τῆς χρυσῆς βοὸς νεὼν, προσπέμπουσι τῷ μεγάλῳ.” The
seruple lies oonoerning the pointing of ὑπὸ τὸν τῆς χρυσῆς βοὸς
νεών. The sentenoe and sense seems indeed to flow more
smoothly, if you should render it thus, “ The springs which,
nourishing Little Jordan, as it is called, send it out into the
(hest, under the temple of the golden ealf :” but then a just ,
doubt arisoth of the situation os that temple. That clause,
therefore, is rather to be referred to the foregoing‚ so that
the sense may go thus; “ The springs, whieh, nourishing
Little Jordan, as it is called, under the temple of the golden
ealf, send it into the Great :'' and so you have the temple of
the golden ealf at the springs of Jordan, and the plaoe ad-
jacent called Daphne, and the marshes of Samoohonitis reaoh-
ing thither.

Thes Jerusalem Gemarists do thus explain those words of
Ezekiel, ohap. xlvii. 8: “ These waters go forth into the east
coast: προ ‘am επ ππ that is, inco 2100 take Samocmitis.
And they shall go down into the plain3 that is, into the sea
of Tiberias. And they shall go out into the sea3 that is, into

the Dead Sea.''
