said, Let my portion be in this land.”

Note, how Abraham coming into the land os Canaan is
first brought into the north part os it; sor there was ‘Scala
Tyriorum,' ⁶ The ladder of the Tyrians.’ Canaan, in like
manner with his sons, travelling from Babylon went the same
way, and possesseth first the north parts, both those that
were without the land of Canaan, and those that were parts

Ι. ἾἾἸἾΝ Arcadi, the Arvadites. Which word in all ver-

“ because they wrought in *2223 Zemer, woollen manufacture.”
But ‘ Chamats' and ⁶ Apamia’ are convertible terme in the
Jerusalem Talmudists: ΥὩΓΠ Nn* W'DDN‘! Nn* “ The sea
