Sncr. 111.-T7ae Scythopolitan country.

Tanau: was a fourth, and that the greatest, passage betwixt
Chammath and J ericho, but at a great distance from either;
for the finding out of which, we are to consider what is
intimated‚ 1 Kings iv. 12: ‘⁶ And all Beth-shean, which is
by Zartanah beneath Jezreel.'' And again, 1 Kings vii. 46:
⁴⁴ ln the plain of Jordan did the king cast them, in the clay·
ground, between Succoth and Zarthan.'’ We will begin with
Beth-shean.

Ι. Beth-shean¹‚ or Scythopolis, was in the lot of Manasseh‚
Judg. i. 27. Greek, Καὶ οὐκ ἐξῇρε Μανασσῆ τὴν Βαιθσὰν, ἥ
ἐστι Σκυθῶν πόλις· “ Neither did Manasses drive out the in-
habitants of Beth-shean, which is Scythopolis.'' So that it
was within the limite of Samaria, though indeed one of the
Decapolitan citios, and within the jurisdiction of the Gentiles,
as we have shewed elsewhere.

II. It was the utmost bound of Samaria towards Galilee.
“Thek bounds of Galilee on the south is Σαμαρίς τε καὶ Σκυ-
θόπολις μέχρι τῶν Ἰορδάνου ῥείθρων· Samaria and Scythopolis
as far as the river Jordan.'’

III. 'Phe city was half a league's distance from Jordan,
saith Borchard, and yet extends its jurisdiction beyond J or-
dan. That of AEthicus‚ in his Oosmography, is well known ε
“ The river Jordan hath its head in mount Libanus, runs
about the lake of Tiberias3 from whence going out, hath its
current through the midst of Scythopolis, and issues in the
Dead Sea.'' Jordan divided Scythopolis in the midst; not
the city (for that was at some considerable distance from the
river), but the country itself; so that part of the country was
on this, and part on the other side Jordan.

It was a noble city of the Syro-Greoians, and had consi-
derable jurisdictiom not only within the confines of Manasses,
but extended itself beyond, even to Perea.
