Tho lanyuaye of Ashdod. 355

5. Tho lanquayo qusladod, Neh. xiii. 24, whether tho
Samaritan lanyuaye or no ?

“ Andf the children spake half in the speech of Ashdod,
and could not speak in the J ews’ language.” What language ’
was this at this time?

Ι. The Arabian version tells us it was the Chaldee. But
was not the J ewish and the Chaldee tongue at that time all
one? It may be questionable whether it were so “ at that
time or no ;'' but Ι shall wave that controversy.

II. As to the question in hand, it may not be amiss to
consider that passage, Acts ii. 11 ε Κρῆτες καὶ Ἀραβες,
“ Cretes and Arabians.” who are these Cretes? who would
not think, at first sight, that, by the Cretans were meant
the inhabitants of the island of Crete? I myself have some-
time fallen into this error; but now I should be ready to
say they were the Chen-ethim, a Phili-stine nation aud coun-
try. ΟἾΤᾊΞ, by the Greek interpreters is rendered Κρῆτες,
Cretes, Ezek.' xxv. 16, Zeph. ii. 5, 6: and there is some rea-
son to apprehend that St.. Luke, in the place above quoted,
understands the same people, because 116 joins them with the
Arabiane.

Observe, Arabiam dwelliny in Gerar, a city of 1116 Phi·
listines 3—and it is well enough known that Arabia joins to
the land os the Philistines. And one may suspect the lan-
guage of Ashdod might be the Arabian, rather than the Sa-
maritan tongue; especially when as the name of Idumea
obtained as far as these places: and was not the Arabio 1116

ΙΝ 1116 Samariten version (that I may still contain myself
within our Chorographical Inquiry), as to the names of
places, there are three things are matter of our notice, and
a fourth of our suspicion.
