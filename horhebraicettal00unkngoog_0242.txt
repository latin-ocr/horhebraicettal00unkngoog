So also Luke: when, according to the order of the story, one
would think it should rather be said, εἷς Βηθανίαν καὶ Βηθ-
φαγὴ, ‘ To Bethany and Bethphage.' For Christ, in his tra-
velling, came to Bethany‚ and there lodged, John xii. [1.]; and
from that city ’went forward by the space almost of a mile,
before he came as far as Bethphage. And yet it is named by
them in this order, ‘⁶ To Bethphage and Bethany ;” that it
might be shewn that the story is to be understood of the
place where Bethany and Bethphage touch upon one another τ
Matthew therefore names Bethphage alone.

We have elsewhere shewn more at large these two things
out of the Talmudists, which do not a little tend to the
clearing of this matter:

1. That a tract, or one part of mount Olivet, was called
Bethany‚ not from the town of that name, where Lazarus
dweIt. but the town was so called from that tract 3 and that
tract from the dates or palm trees growing there, *⁴:⁸57 5³³2
Beck Hem, the place (ff dates. ’

ΙΙ. That there was no town at all named Bethphage, but
another tract of Olivet was so called, for yram flys growing
there3 that is the meaning of ’ᾖε ΠἾΞ, ΒθίῘιορΙιαφῖ, ‘ The
place of green figs ς’ and that the village, or outmost street
of Jerusalem, lying next it, was called by the same name.

We observed‚ also, that that place in mount Olivet, where
these two tracts Bethany and Bethphage touched on one
another, was a sabbath-day’s journey from the city, or there-
abouts. Which how it may be applied to illustrate the pre-
sent business we are upon, let us say a few things concerning
such a journey.

How far the bounds of a sabbath-day’s journey reached,
every one knows: and every one knows that that space was
measured out every way without the citios, that the certain
bounds might be fixed, and that there might be no mistake;
and that, by some evident mark, the limits might be known,
that they might not remain doubtful in a thing wherein they
placed so much religion.

These are the rules of the masters concerning measuring
two thousand cubits from every side of the city:
