82·οΤ. Ι.-Α few remarks upon tlte Samaritam affairs.
1. Of the name of the Cuthites.

ΤΗΑΤ the ‘ Samaritans' are called ‘ Cuthites' by the Jews
is unquestionable; Ol. κατὰ μὲν τὴν Ἑβραίων γλῶτταν Χου-

Hebrew tongue are called Outhaeans‚ in the language of the
Greeks are Samaritans.''

But why Cuthites rather than Babyloniam, Hamathites‚
Avites‚ &c., is uncertain: for thence, as well as from Cutha,

nay, they were called Guthites even at that time when a
great part of the Samaritan nation consisted of Jews.

I am apt to apprehend there was some virulent design
even in the very name. The name of Cushites amongst the
Jews was most loathsome and infamous; as they were not
only a hostile country, but a people accursed‚ and, for their
black hue, even hort-id to the very sight. Perhaps in the
title of the seventh Psalm there is no little severity of re·

conjecture, that the Jews, calling the Samaritans (a nation
