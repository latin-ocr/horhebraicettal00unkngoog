itsels held two-and-twenty furlongs :” nor can it well be taken
of the whole circumference of the Tyrian jurisdiction, but
rather os the extent of the bounds os it that way, which he
went.

Εἶθ’ ἦ Πτολεμαῒς ἐστι μεγάλη πόλις, ἢν Ἀκὴν ὠνόμαζον, 810.
“ Moreover‚ from Tyre'’ (southward) “ is Ptolemais, formerly
called Ace. And between Ace and Tyro, is a shore heaped
with sands. fit to make glass.'’

Μετὰ δὲ τὴν Ἀκὴν Στράτωνος πύργος, 830. “ Beyond Ace is
the tower of Strato. The mountain Carmel lies between: and
the names of some small cities, and nothing more. The cities

Here we must stop, and see how these two authors do
