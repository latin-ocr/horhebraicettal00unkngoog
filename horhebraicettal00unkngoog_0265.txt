Gadara. Hippo, 255

brought down thither.’' But is you go to Herodotusf‚ dis-
coursing concerning the empire of the Scythiam in Asia, and
especially in palestine, you will find that that empire was
extinct when tho grandfather of Cyrus was scarce born ε that
it may seem more a wonder that the name of Scythopolis did
so flourish, when the Jews under Cyrus went back to their
own land. But concerning this matter we will not create
more trouble either ιο the reader or to ourselves.

Sscr. III.—G‘adara and Hippo, citios of Decapolis. ·

So Pliny and J osephus in the words lately alleged out of
them: and so the evangeliste not obscurely concerning Ga-
dara. For Mark saith, ‘⁸ He began to preach in Decapolis ;’'
Lake, “ He departed preaching throughout all the city of
Gadara.’'

And that Gadara was of heathcn jurisdiction‚ besides what
may be gathered out of those words of J osephus, may be
made out also from thence, that hogs were kept there in so
great a number, Matt. viii: the keeping of which was for-
bidden the Jews by the Talmudic canons, as well as the
eating them by the Mosaic law. Hence in our notes on
Mark v, we are not afraid to pronounce that possessed Gada-
rene to be a heathen; and that, is our conjecture fail us not.
upon good grounds.

That Hippo also was of heathen jurisdiction, the testi-
monies of the Jews concerning the city Susitha may suffi-
ciently argue: which as it is os the same signification with
the word Hippo, so without all doubt it is the same place.
So they write of its heathenism. ‘⁸ Thes land Tobhh‚ to which
J ephthah fied, is Susitha. And why is the name of it called
Tobh [that is, qood]3 because it is free from tithes.” And
whence came it to be free from tithe? because it was of hea-
then possession. For there was no tithing without the land,
that is, out of any place which belonged to the heathen. And
again, “If two witnessesi come forth out of a city, the greater
part of which consists of Gentiles, as Susitha‚” διο.
