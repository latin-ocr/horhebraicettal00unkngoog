Hannon, the most eminent among them, excites us to
remember the rest. “ Thes Rabbins deliver this; Moses
separated three cities of refuge beyond Jordan, [Dent. iv. 41,
42, 43 ς] and, against them, Joshua separated three cities in
the land of Canaan, [J osh. xx. 7, 8.] And these were placed
by one another, just· as two ranke of vines are in a vineyard:
Hebron in J udea against Bezer in the wilderness: Shechem
in mount Ephraim against Ramoth in Grilead: Kedesh in
mount Napthali against Golan in Basan. And these three
were so equally disposed‚ that there was so much space from
the south coast of the land of Israel to Hebron, as there was
from Hebron to Shechem; and as much from Hebron to
Shechem‚ as from Shechem to Kedesh; and as much from

Shechem to Kedesh, as from Kedesh to the north coast of
the land.’'

It b was the Sanhedrim's business to make the ways to
those cities convenient, by enlarging them, and by removing
every stop, against which one might either stumble or dash
his foot. No hillock or river was allowed to be in the way,
over which there was not a bridge: and the way, leading
thither, was, at least, two-and-thirty cubits broad. And in
every double way, or in the parting os the ways, was written

χώρῃ, τέφρη ‘⁶ 301²qu refuge, ”-1est he that fied thither
might mistake the way.

'rhei mothers of the high-priest used to seed and clothe
those, that for murder were shut up in the cities of refuge,
that they might not pray for the death of their sons‚—since
the fugitive was to be restored to his country and friends at
the death of the high-priest: but if he died before in the city
of refuge, his bones were ιο be restored after the death of the
high-priest.

The k Jews dream ¹, that in the days os the Messias, three
other cities are to be added to those six which are mentioned
