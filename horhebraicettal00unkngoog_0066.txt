Πόλις, one might call it ‘ The New Oity Χ) ” And yet there is
a place where he seems to distinguish between Bezetha and
the New City: for he saith concerning Cestius, Κέστιοςῑ δὲ
παρελθὼν, δια, “ But Cestius, passing over, set fire upon
Bezetha, so called, and the New Gity.’'

Bezethaz was seated on the north part of Antonia, and
that and Caenopolis (or the New Gity) filled up that space,
where Sion ended on the east, and was not stretched out so
far as Acra was· Invidet* ὑπερχεομένη (ἡ πόλις) κατὰ μικρὸν
ἐξεῖρπε τῶν περιβόλων, &o., “ (The city), abounding with
people, crept, by litt-le and little, out of the walls: and on
the north side of the Temple, at the hill, making a city, went
onward not a little; καὶ τέταρτον περιοικηθῆναι λόφον, ὃς καλεῖ-
ται Βεζεθὰ, διο. and a fourth hill is inhabited, which is called
Bezetha,’' διο. ’

Interpreters differ about Millo. There is oneb, who sup-
poses it to be a large place, appointed for public meetings and
assemblies. Anotherc interprets it of heaps of earth, thrown
up against the wall within, whence they might more easily
get up upon the wall: and when David is said to build
Mino, that he erected towers upon these heaps, and banks.
Some others there are, who understand it of the valley or
street that runs between Jerusalem and Sion; and so it is
commonly marked out in the maps,—when, in tmth, Millo
was a part of Sion, or some hillock cast up against it on the
west side.

Let that be observed, 2 Chron. xxxii. 53 &5³7sz ''1¹32ss mm]

ἺἾᾛΓ 'vy ‘⁶ And he restored, or fortified, Mille, of the city of

David :'' or, as our English reads, “ in the city of David.'’
The Seventy read, τὸ ἆνάλημμα τῆς πόλεως Δαυὶδ, “ the fortifi-
cation of the city of David.'’ When, therefore, David is said
to build “ Mino, and more inwards‚” it is all one as ir he
had said, ‘ he built on the uttermost part of Sion, which was
called Millo, more inwardly to his own castle.' And J oab
repaired the rest, 1 Ohron. xi. 8.
