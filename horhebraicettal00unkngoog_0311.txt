Αἵ εἰσιν ἐπάνω τῶν ὁρίων Αὖραυίτιδος, “ which are upon the
borders of Auranitis.''

Hauran is reeltoned up amongst those hius, at the top os
which, by lifting up some flaming torches, they were wont to
give notice of the new year. ’

to Both Baetin. And from Beth Baltin‚ he that held up the

The· Gemarist queries, ‘⁸ What is Beth-Baltin? Rabh
saith, It is Biram. What is the captivity3 Rabh J oseph
saith, It is Pombeditha.'’ Gloss: ‘⁴ The sense of it is this:
That Biram is in the land of lsrael? How! is Biram the
same with Beth Baltin, and yet is Biram within the land of
Israel? when, in the Jerusalem Gomara, “ Rabh Honna
saith, When we oame hither‚ we went up to the top of Beth
Baltin‚ and discerned the palm trees in Babylon.’' If this
be true, the geographers are to consider whether there can
‘ be any prospect of Babylon from the land of lsrael. ln
their sense it may be true enough, who commonly by the
name of Babylon understand all those countries into which
the Babylonish eaptivity were carried ; not only Chaldea,
but Mesopotamia also, and Assyria. So that bounding the
land of Israel with the river Euphrates (which, indeed, the
Holy Scriptures themselves do), they make it contiguous with
Mesopotamia, the river only between; and they place Beth
Baltin not far from the bank on this side the river.

The Gemarists aeknowledge that light-s were lifted up upon

these were the most known and celebrated, and therefore they
named them only. Now it is probable enough that mount
Ham-an gave the denomination to the whole country Auran-
