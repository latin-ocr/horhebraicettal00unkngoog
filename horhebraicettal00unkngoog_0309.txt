Trachonitvb. 299

Gaulonitis too; for we meet with that distinction also in
J osephus ⁰. To give, therefore, all these countries at this
time their proper bounds and limite, if it does not exceed all
human skill and wit, I am sure it doth mine.

Sor that all we can do in this matter, is only ιο propound
a few things of these places thus divided, as far as conjec-
ture may carry us, which we submit fairly to the fair and
candid judgment of the reader. Let us, therefore, begin with
Trachonitis.

Sscr. IV .—Traclaonitis.

Ancon, mentioned Deut. iii. 14, is, by the Targumists‚
called &mmo and ᾺΠἹΣἾὯ Tmohona. And so J onath.
1 Kings iv. 13: the Samariten hath it·‚ ΠΝΞἹᾹἿἾ Riyobaah,
which seems akin to ΣΠ Reqab, amongst the Talmudists.

“ Tekoahq bath the preeminence for eil: Abba Saul saith,

ground, with which this country abounds, are called dragous.
Indeed, almost all the people of this country have their dwell-
ings in dens and caves3 and in these kind of dragons.’'

Other things might be offered as ιο ι1ι6 signification of
the worda but we are looking after the situation of the
place, not the etymology of the name. And the first thing
to be inquired into, as to its situation, is, whether it extended
in longitude from the south ιο the north, or from the west
ιο the east. The reason of our inquiry is, partly upon the
account of Auranitis, which we are to speak of presently‚
and partly those words in J osephus, ὡρίζετο δὲ αὐτ-ᾖ [Βαταναία]
τῇ Τραχωνίτιδι· “ Batanea ⁸ was bounded with Trachonitis.”
How so? Either that Batanea lay between Perea and Tra-
chonitis, extending itself from the west towards the east, or
between Trachonitis and Galilee, strictly so called, extend-
