Bmfflmr 8001118 10 110 1110 801110 with ”2³17 rw: among the
Talmudiste. Of which they write 111118. They¹¹ treat in the
place, noted in the margin, ooneerning eating of fruits the
seventh year, and ooneerning ἾἸΏἪ Beor, of which we have
epoke beforeo. They inquire, How long one may eat of these
or the other fruite ss—And they 81010 1110 business thus:
“ They eat Olives (say they) until the 1081 000808 in Tekoa.
R. Eleazar saith, Until the 1081 000808 in Gush Chalab” (in
1110 tribe of Aeher). “ They eat dry fige, until green fige 00080
³:³07 rw: in Beth-hene. R. Judah saith, The green fige of
Beth-hene are not mentioned; unless in respect of the tenthe3
08 1110 tradition ie, ἾΠἸῑΔἾ *amm *ww 1¹5³: *20 810. Τ110
fige of Beth-hene, and the dates of Tubni‚ are bound to 110
tithed.” The Gloee is thie 3 “They are not mentioned in the
80110018 among fruite, 11111088 in respect of tithing.” These
words are recited in Erubhin: where Ρ 1110 word ³:⁸27 ΠἿΞ
Beth-hem is writ, ὍἹἾἹἿἎ Beth-jone, and '3:510 Tubni is writ
&2³:³10 mna.

Beth-hene certainly seems to be the same altogether with
our Balaam,- and the name to be drawn from the word ὍἿΠΝ
Aheno, which signifiee the “ dates of palm-trees? not 001110
10 ripeness: 08 1110 ἿἉΕ 0180 signifies “ green-fige‚” that ie,
811011 fige 08 are not yet ripe.

And now take 0 prospect a little of mount olivet. Here
you may see olive-treee3 and in that plaoe ie Getheemane‚
“ The place of oil·presses.” There yon may 800 palm-trees
growing; and that place is called Bethany‚ ³:³³ rw: “ The
plaoe of (10108.” And we may obeerve in 1110 goepel-history,
how 111080 11101 11101 Christ, 08 110 was going forward from
Bethany, had branohes of palm-trees ready at hand. There
you may see lig-trees growing; and that place was oalled
Bethphage, “ The plaoe of green-fige.”
