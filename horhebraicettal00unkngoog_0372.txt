to it, out of Neh. iii. ι), or, at least, Bethesda, was near the
Temple. Consult the commentatore, and they almost all
agree in this opinion. With their good leave, let it not be
amiss to interpose these two or three things:

Ι. That no part of the outward wall of the city (which
this Sheep-yate was) could be so near the Temple, but that
some part of the city must needs lie between. Betwixt the
north gates and the Temple, Zion was situated; on the west,
was part of Zion and Millo; on the south, Jerusalem, as it is
distinguished from Zion3 on the east, the east street, whose
gate is not the Sheep-qate, but the Water-gate.

II. The Προβατικῆ πύλη, the Skeepyate‚ according to Ne-
hemiah's description, should be situated on the south ¹¹ wall
of the city, not far from the corner that pointed south-east;
'so that a considerable part of Jerusalem lay betwixt the
Temple and this gat-e.

We have elsewhere made it plain that Sion was situated
on the north part of the city, contrary to the mistake of the
tableS, which place it on the south. Now, therefore, consi-
der to how great an extent the wall must run before it can
come to any part of Zion ς to wit, to the stairs that go down
from the city of David, ver. 15, which were on the west ; and
thence proceed to the sepulchres of David, ver. 16; till it
come at length to the ¹ Water-gate‚ and Ophel towards the
east, ver. 26: ancl thence to the corner near which is the
Sheepyate, ver. 31, 32³ and this will plainly evince that
the description and progress in Nehemiah is, first, of the
south wall, from the Sheep-qate to the west corner; then
of the west wal13 and so to the northern and the eastern3
which makes it evident that the Sheep-yate is on the south
wall, a little distant from the corner which looks south-east,
which could not but be a considerable distance from the

Temple, because no small part of Jerusalem, as it was dis·
tinguished from Zion, laid between.

Our inquiry into Bethesda (if I be not greatly mistaken)
must take its rise from the sountain of Siloam.
