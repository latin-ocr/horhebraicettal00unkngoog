sake of purity: nor is there in it a house for shutting out
suspected of the leprosy: nor is it polluted with leprosy: nor
is it become any way a city to be cursed for idolatry‚” &c.

“ Nevern did serpent or scorpion harm any one within
Jerusalem. Nor did ever any one say to his neighbour‚
‘ The place wherein I am entertained at Jerusalem is too
strait for me.''’

‘⁶ There⁰ is no anathema at Jerusalem, nor bath any man
stumbled. Nor hath a fire or a ruin happened there: nor
hath any one said to his neighbour, ‘ I found not a hearth to
roast my passover,' or ‘ I found not a bed to lie on.' In it
they do not plant trees, except gai-dens of roses, which were
there from the days of the former prophete: they do not
nourish in it peacocks, or cocks, much less hogs,” aa.

The fathers of the traditionsp give this reason, why they
do not allow gardens in the city: ‘⁴ They make no gardens

why they might not keep cocks: ‘⁸ It is also forbidden the
Israelites to keep cocks in Jerusalem ” (the priests may no

hills, and thence perhaps they might rake up the bones of
creeping things; whence those holy things, which are to be
caten, might be polluted.'''

Gardens without the city were very frequent, and they
