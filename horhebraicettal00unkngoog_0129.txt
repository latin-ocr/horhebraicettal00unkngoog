passed a city with a very fair wall twenty furlongs, and
brought six thousand inhabitants into ith :” (do you think
all these were Samaritans ἕ) “ and on these he bestowed a
very fertile land; and, in the middle of this work, he set up
a very great temple to Gaesar, and made a grove about it of
three half furlongs, and called the city Sebaste.’'

“ The Samaritam (saith R. Benjamini) have not the letters
Π (Η6), or y (Ain), or Π (cheth). Π (Η6) is in the name of
Abraham, ἿἹΠ :nb *m And thoy have not honour. Π,
cheth, is in the name o} Isaac, ἾΟΠ :ab pm And they Ιιαυο
not morey. y (Ain) is in the name of Jacob, 0147 ΓΝἸ
fluv And thoy have not ymlene'ss. But for these letters they
use Ν (Aleph): and hence it is known that they are not of the
seed of Israel.'' Compare these things with the saman-itan
interpreter of the Pentateuch, and judge.

Tun Arabian interpreter thinks the first name of this city
was Hazor, J osh. xi. 1. 'l'he Jews, Ekron, Zeph. ii. 4. “ R.
Abhu saith ¹²,'' (he was of caesarea) Ἶξξῌ Γῆῆᾌ “ Ekron
shall be rooted out ;'' this is Caesarea, the daughter of Edom‚
which is situated among things profane. She was a goad‚
sticking in Israel, in the days of the Grecians. But when

the kingdom of the Asmonean family prevailed, it evercame
her, sm. R. J osi Bar Chaninah saith, What is that that is

written, ‘And Ekron shall be as a Jebusite? (Zech. ix. 7.)

These are the theatres and judgment-seats which are in
Edom‚ in which the chief men of J udah hereafter shall pub-

licly teach the law, R. Isaac said, Leshem is Panias, and
Ekron is Oaesarea, the daughter of Edom.''

The Jews are scarce in earnest when they say Oaesarea is
the same with Ekron: but partly, they play with the sound
of the words ῘἽἾΡᾩ ‘ Ekron,' and Ἶρξηῗὶ ‘ shall be rooted out ς’
partly, they propound to themselves to reproach her, while

they compare that city, for the most part heathen, with
Ekron, the city of Beelzebub.
