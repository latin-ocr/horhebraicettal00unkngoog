Shichin, and the poor of Caphar Hananiah, came: ¹737 ΓΞΦΠὩἸ
owni-m and when it now yrew dark, they contained them-
selves within tha bounds [of the sabbath]‚ and in the morning
went forward.'' The Gloss is, ‘⁶ Arumah is the name of a
place. The poor of Caphar Shichin were neighbours to those
of Arumah, being distant only four thousand (cubita).” Which
distance exceeding a sabbath-day’s journey, the poor, before
the coming-in of the sabbath, contained themselves within
the bounds of Arumah; that, the morning following, they
might betake themselves to the houses of those that dis·
tributed their charity‚ and not break the sabbath. He that
turns over the Talmudical writers will meet with very fre-
quent mention of this city.

You observe before in Pliny, that Sycaminum was seated
between Dor and Carmel 3 and in the Talmudic writers, that
the plenty of sycamines began at Caphar Hananiah.

Tho disposition os the tribes in Galiloe.

Tus country of Samaria contained only two tribes, and
those of the brethren, Ephraim and M anasses ε Galilee four,
Issachar, Zebulun, Nephthalim, and Asher, and a part also of
the Danites. -

The maps agree indeed about the order in which these
tribes were seated, but about the proper place of their situa-
tion, Oh how great a disagreement is there among them!
The tribe of Issachar held the south country of Galilee ε some
maps place it on the south of the sea of Gennesaret, not illy:
but it is ill done of them to stretch it unto the sea itself:
and others, worst of all, who set it on the west of that sea.
Of this land J osephus writes thus; xa2⁸ μετὰ τούτοις Ἰσάχαρις,
Κάρμηλόν τε ὅρος, καὶ τὸν ποταμὸν τοῦ μήκους ποιησαμένη τέρ-
μονα, τὸ δὲ Ἰταβύριον ὅρος τοῦ vadi-ovs: “ And after these (the
Manassites) Issachar maketh mount Carmel and the river her
bounds in length, and mount Itaburion in breadth.”

The country of Zabulon touched upon that of Issachar on
the north. Some maps spread it out unto the sea of Genne-
saret3 some plaoe it a long way above that sea northwardly;
