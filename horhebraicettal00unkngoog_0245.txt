Μ iydal Eder. 235

please, their distinction between Πῠῆτο snatchinq away by a
wild beast, and ΠΟἾἿἾ teariny, in the place cited, where they
discuss it at large.

Travellers speak of a cistern near the town of Bethany,
“near which, in a field, is shewn the place where Martha
met our Lord coming to Bethany.” They are the words of
Borchard the monk. Whether the thing itself agrees with
this whereof we are speaking, must be left uncertain.

ΒΥ occasion of these places discovered to us by the Tal-
mudists‚ I cannot but observe another also out of them on
another· side of the city, not further distant from the city
than that- whereof we now spake‚ if it were as far distant as
that; that is, Miydal Edor, or tho Tower os the Flook, dif-

strayed out of Jerusalem3 for very many cattle going out
thence were to be sacrificed.”

They have a tradition not unlike this, as we said before,
of money found within Jerusalemt “ Moneysq which are
found in Jerusalem, before those that buy cattle, are always
tithes,” &c.

But to our business. From the words alleged we infer
that there was a tower or a place by name Migdal Eder, but
