lightful cave in a mountain; and under it the land hollowing
itself into a huge vale, full of standing waters. Over it a
great mountain hangs; and under the cave, rise the springs
of the river J ordan.”

And again, Παρὰο τὰς Ἰορδάνου πηγάς· καλεῖται δὲ Πάνιον ὀ
τόπος· “ By the springs of Jordan: now the place is called
Panium.”

And elsewhere P, Δοκεῖ μὲν Ἰορδάνου πηγὴ τὸ Πάνιον· “ Pa-
nium seems to be the sountain of Jordan :” and more may be
read there.

The Talmudists write thus; “ Rabhq saith, Ny'l'· ζἾἾἿ
ΟἿἾὈΞ ΠἾΏὉΥ) Jordan riseth out os the cave of Pamias: and
so is the tradition.''

collected from J osephus. Concerning the Danites invading
Laish‚ or Leshem, which being subdued they called Dan, he
speaks thus3 Οἱ δ’ ¹⁵ οὗ πόρρω τοῦ Λιβάνου ὄρους καὶ ἐλάσσονος
Ἰορδάνου τῶν πηγῶν, διο. “ But they, travelling a day's journey
through the great plain of Sidon, not far from mount Libanus,
and the springs of lesser Jordan, observe the land to be good
and fruitful, and shew it unto their tribe 3 who, invading it
with an army, build the city Dan.”

In like manner speaking of J eroboam, he saith these
things; ‘⁶ Heu built two temples for the golden calves,—one
in Beth-el, ἕτερον δὲ ἑν Δάνῃ, ἥ δέ ἐστι πρὸς ταῖς πηγαῖς τοῦ

μικροῦ Ἰορδάνουε the other in Dan, which is at the springs of
