Nain. 31 l

with our Nain: for it is very absurd to conceive that our
Saviour ever was at Ham-enan, the utmost borders of the
land towards Syria; nor can we suppose him in ljon‚ that
seeming to be according to the order of the places as they are
ranked in the text above quoted, either beyond Dan, or in
the extremest borders of the land on that side.

As to our Nain, Borchard saith thus ; “ A Nazareth duabus
leucis,'' διο. “ Two leagues from Nazareth, not much above
one from mount Tabor southward, is mount Hermon the
less, on the north side of which is the city Nain; at whose
gates J esus recovered a widow's son from death, as we read
Luke vii.” So also Breidenbach: so some tables as to the
situation of Hermon and Tabor‚ near the situation of Nain
near Hermon.

1 am well enough satisfied that they should place Nain in
the tribe of Issachar, if there be no mistake among them
as to mount Tabor‚ For whereas Tabor is indeed the very
utmost border of Issachar northward, Josh. xix. 22, ith must
needs be that what is beyond that southward, a league or
tva, should be reckoned within that tribe. But 1 much sus-
pect the Tabor mentioned by them, and that which is now
shewn to travellers, is not the true Tabor: nor do Ι much
question but that Hermon, of which they talk, is made out
of a mistake and miscenstruction of Psalm lxxxix. 1 2, “Tabor
and Hermon shall rejoioe in thy name.'' My scruple as to
mount Tabor ariseth hencei 3 because that k Tabor‚ which is
shewn to strangers, as our countryman Biddulph ¹, and another
acquaintance of mine own, who were on the top of it, do de-
scribe it, does not at all agree with the description -losephus
gives us of the true mount Tabor‚ Our countryman tells us,
“ It is a hill not very steep‚ nor very high, nor very large;
but a round beautiful hill‚’' διο. On the contrary, Ἰταβύριον
ὄρος οὗ τὸ μὲν ὕψος ἐπὶ τριάκοντα σταδίους ἀνίσχει, μόλις προσ-
βατὸν κατὰ τὸ προσάρκτιον κλίμα, πεδίον δέ ἐστιν ἡ κορυφὴ, στα-
δίων ἓξ καὶ εἴκοσι· “ Mountm Tabor is in height thirty furlongs,
very difficult of ascent on the north side; the top is a great
plain of about six-and-twenty furlongs.''
