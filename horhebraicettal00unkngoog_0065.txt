Bozaha. Mwo. 55

The same author thus describes the burning of the Lower
city: Τό τεῦ ἀρχεῖον, καὶ τὴν Ἀκραυ, καὶ τὸ βουλευτήριον, καὶ
τὴν Ὀφλᾶν ὑφῆψαν· καὶ προῦκοψε τὸ πῦρ μέχρι τῆς Ἑλένης
βασιλείων, ἃ δὴ κατὰ μέσην τὴν Ἀκραν ἦν· “ Thon they fired
the] Archivum and Aera, and the mancii-house, and ophla:
and the fire destroyed unto the palaces of Helen, which were
in the middle of Acra.”

Ι. Ἀρχεΐον, the Arabicum. Whether he means tho ma-
yzbtrates’ court, or tho repository qs the ancient reeords,
according to the different signification of the word, we do
not determine. There were certainly sacred records in the
Temple, and civil records no doubt in the city, where writ-
ings and memoriale of sales, contracte, donatione, and public
acts, διε. were laid up. 1 should more readily understand
this of their rqmitom, than of the maqistrates’ court,
because, presently after, the council-house is distinctly
named.

ΙΙ. Aera .- that is, either the buildings, which were upon
the very head and top of the mount, or some garrison or
castle in the mount. In which sense that word doth not
seldom occur in the history of the Maccabeos, aud in
J osephus.

ΙΙΙ. Tho coemit-homo. He mentions elsewhere βουλὴ the
coancil, and that, as it seems, in the Upper city. For he
saith, that “ thet outmost wall on the north began at the
Hippio tower, and went forward to the Xystus3 ἔπειτα τῇ
βουλῇ συνάπτον, and thence, touching upon tho covmeil'⁹ (or
the court), “it went onward opposite¹¹¹ against the west wall<
of the Temple.’' The council in the Upper City you may not
improperly interpret the ‘ Gourt of the King :³ the council·
house in the Lower city, the council of the Sanhedrim, whi-
ther it went, when it departed from the Tabernae. =

IV. Ophla. ophel, Neh. iii. 26.

There¹ was also a fourth hill, saith the same J osephus, ὃς
καλεῖται Βεζεθὰ, “ which was called Bezetha, situate over-
against Antonia, and divided from it with a deep ditch. Now
Bezetha, if you would render it in Greek, Καιυὴ λέγοιτ’ ἂν
