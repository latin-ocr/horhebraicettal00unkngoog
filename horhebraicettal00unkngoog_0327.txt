Emmaus. Timnatlz. Mount Gicead. 317

plaoes named along with it, in what quarter of the heaven
it was situated. To all which we may add that of J osephus‚
Antiq. lib. xii. eap. 11. [xii. 7. 4.] and 1 Maee. iv: Judas
Maeeabeus engages with Gorgias near Emmaus: the Gor-
gians fly, and the Maeeabeans pursue, μέχρι Γαδάρων, καὶ τῶν
πεδίων τῆς Ἰδουμαίας, καὶ Ἀζώτου, καὶ Ἰαμνείας, “ as far as
Gadaron (Gezer) to the plains of Idumea, Azotus, and J am-
n1a.'’

I therefore reeite this passage, that it may appear that
Emmaus lay towards Galilee, although from Jerusalem it in-
clined also westward. For whereas, eonesrning the latitude
of Galilee extending itself from west to east, there must of
neeessity be several roads from Jerusalem to this or that part
of it ; so this through Emmaus was one, through Beth-horon
another, through Antipatris a third; if, at least, this last
did not sall in with that os Emmaus. That passage in Gul.
Tyriusb makes me think it might-,3 who, desoribing the en-
eampings and journeyings of the erusade army, tells us,
“ Leaving the maritime towns, Antipatris and J oppa on the
right, they passed through Eleutheris, and came to Lydda,
whieh is Diospolis.” And eap. 24, “ From whenee, taking
guides along with them, persons well skilled in those places,
they came to Nieopolis :'’ whieh is the same with Emmaus.

From all whieh we may reasonably presume that the two
diseiples were going to Emmaus, not as to the utmost limit
of their journey, but as that lay in their way towards Galilee.

To what tribe Emmaus belonged would be something
hard to determine, because of the situation of Beth-horon,

whieh was in Ephraim, Josh. xvi3 but that the Talmudists .

do elearly enough say, it was not in the Samaritan country.

“ They<² were servants of the priests, saith R. Meir. But
R. J ose saith, They were of the family of Beth Pegai-im, and
Beth Zippory, in Emmaus, who had plaeed their daughters in
marriage with the priests.”
