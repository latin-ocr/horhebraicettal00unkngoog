Abilene. 305

Tiberias, that was three stories high; had a lower, a middle,
and an upper dining·room ⁰. Which, indeed, was fortified‚
and held a garrison of soldiers in it.

So that we may, not without reason, conjecture the Iturea
of which we now speak might be so called from ἾἾἹΓῬΠ
Clamare, such kind of diyyinqs under ground: and that
Pliny and Strab0, when they talk os the ‘⁴ nation of the ‚Itu-
reans in Cyrrhestica and Chalcis,” do not place the country
of Iturea there 3 only hinted that the Troglodytes, who dwelt
in dens and caves, aiere there.

Iturea therefore, mentioned by our evangeliste, was in the
country beyond Jordan, viz. Batanea and Auranitis, or Au-
ranitis alone, as may appear out of J osephuS, compared with
this our evangelist. For St. Luke saith, that ‘⁶ Philip was
tetrarch of Iturea and Trachonitis :’' J osephus, that he was
tetrarch of Trachonitis, Batanea, and Auranitis. Either,
therefore, Auranitis and Batanea in J osephus is the Iturea in
St. Luke, or else Batanea in J osephus is confounded with
Trachonitis mentioned in St. Luke, and Auranitis alone is
Iturea. For that passage in J osephusP ought to be taken
notice of ε Δωρεῖται τὸν Ἀγρίππαν τῇ Φιλίππου τετραρχίᾳ, καὶ
Βαταναίᾳ, προσθεὶς αὐτῷ τὴν Τραχωνίτιυ σὺν Ἀβέλλᾳ· “ Oaesar
invests Agrippa with the tetrarchy that Philip had, and Ba-
tanea, adding moreover Trachonitis with Abella.’' Where
it is observable‚ that there is mention of the tetrarchy of
Philip, distinct from Batanea and Trachonitis. And what

is that? certainly Auranitis in J osephus‚ and perhaps Iturea
in St. Luke.

Jmmrmm, in the words before quoted, speaking of Abella,
adds thie passag63 Λυσανίᾳ δὲ αὕτη ἐγεγόνει τετραρχία, “ that
had been the tetrarchy of Lysanias. '' So also Ptolemy;
Ἀβίλα ἑπικληθεῖσα Λυσανίου, “ Abila, that bore the name of
Lysaniae :” and he reckons this up among the cities of Coelo-
syria, under these degrees :— ’

Heliopolis 68. 40. 33. 40.
Abila . . 68. 45. 33. 20.
Plinyq speaks of Abila in that country: “ Paneas, in qua Cae-
