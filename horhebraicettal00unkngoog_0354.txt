*sinim the ⁶ Manchathites’ are by them called muffet* the
‘Epikerites‚’ Deut. iii. 14; Josh.'xiii. ι 3. And this, probably,
from the place or country where the Maachathites of old
dwelt‚ which, in the time of the Targumists‚ was called
Ἐπίκαιρος, ἀπ’ ἀνατολῶν ποταμοῦ Ἰορδάνου, “ Epicaerus on
the east of the river Jordan‚'' deg. 67. 3¹· οδ. Whether in-
deed the situation doth fal} out right, 1 shall not at present
discourse.

But the ‘ Kenite’ is not termed a ‘ Salmean' from any place
or country where he dwelt. For the Kenites in the southern
part of J udea are called ‘ Salamean3‚’ J udg. i. [16.] So also
Heber the Kenite in Galilee, J udg. iv. [11.] And there were
Kenites amongst the AmalekiteS, 1 Sam. xv. [6] ; and there
were of the Kenites beyond Jordan, Gen. xv. [19]: whence
so called is not to our purpose. It sufficeth, that they were
vulgarly known by the name of ΠΝὮΒΦ Salame3 which, how
near akin it is to Σαλεὶμ, Salim, let the unbiassed reader
judge. Who knoweth, therefore, but the evangelist should
mean thus; “John was baptizing in AEnon, near the sala-
mean‚ ‘or Kenite 3³³⁹ giving that name to that people, which,
at that time, they were commonly called by? But supposing
this should be granted us, what Kenite should we understand
here? either those that were in the wilderness of J udah, or
those on the other side of the salt sea?

Ir the ⁶ Essene’ might be called ΠΝὉῙἋΖ] Samma, as well
as Kenite (and certainly he seems to have as much claim to
it, if the word denote perfectiora, or austerity of life), then
1 could more confidently place our Σαλεὶμ, Salim, in the wil-
derness of Judah; because there I find AEnon mentioned in
the Greek version, Josh. xv. 61, 62 : where the Hebrew hath
it thus: ‘⁴ In the wilderness, Beth-araba, Middin, and Seca-

cah, and Nishban, and the city of Salt, and En-gedi, six

cities ε ” but the Greek, καὶ Βαδδαργεὶς, καὶ Θαραβαᾰμ, καὶ

Αἰνὼν, 8ῦο. “ And Baddar9i8‚ and Tharabaam, and AEnon.'’

διο. Where it is plain that Αἰνὼν, AEnon, is put for Middin,·

but why it should be sc, is more difficult to tell. This only
a Pt01.Tab.Asiae 4.
