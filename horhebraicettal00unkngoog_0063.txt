were on the north side of the city, learn of the same author
from these passages that follow :—

He saith plainly, that the towers¹ built by Herod,—the
Psephin tower, the Hippio tower, Sta—were on the north.
“ Titus (saith he ¹¹¹) intrenched two furlongs from the city on
the angular part of the wall near the Psephin tower, where
the circuit of the wall bends from the north towards the
west.” And in the chapter next asten “ The Psephin tower
lifted up itself at the corner of the north, and so westward.”
And in th'e same chapter, describing the compass of the out-
most wall, Ἀρχόμευου δὲ (saith he ιι) κατὰ βοῤῥᾶν ἀπὸ τοῦ
Ἱππικοῦ, &c., “ It began on the north at the Hippio tower,
and went on to the Xystus.''-And when he had described
those towerS, he adds these words, Κειμέυοις δὲ πρὸς ἄρκτον,
&c., ‘⁶ To those towers, situate on the north, was joined, on
the inside, the Gourt.” What can be clearer? The court
was in the Upper city, or Βίους but the court was joined to
the outmost northern wall: therefore, Sion was on the north.

Add to these, those things that follow in the story of
Pompey, produced before. When the court was surrendered
into Pompey's hande, Πομπήϊος δὲ ἔσωθεν στρατοπεδεύεται κατὰ
τὸ βόρειον τοῦ Ἱεροῦ μέρος, “ he encamped on the north part
of the Temple.’' And of Gestius⁰, Πρὸς τὴν ἄνω πόλιν ἐλθὼν,
ἀντικρὺ τῆς βασιλικῆς αὗλῆς ἐστρατοπεδεύετο· “ Being come to
the Upper city, he pitched against the king’s court.'’ And
a little asterP, Κατὰ τὸ προσάρκτιον ἐπιχειρεῖ κλίμα τῷ Ἱερῷ·
“ He attempted the Temple on the north side.''

We shall not urge more at this time. There will occur
here and there to us, as we proceed, such things as may
defend this our opinion: against which what things are
objected, we know well enough; which we leave to the reader
to consider impartially. But these two we cannot pass over in
silence, which seem, with an open face, to make against us:—

Ι. It may be objected, and that not without cause, that
Sion was in the tribe of J udah, but Jerusalem in the tribe of
Benjamin. But now, when the land of J udah was on theq
