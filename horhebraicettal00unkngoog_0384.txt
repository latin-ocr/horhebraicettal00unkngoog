in under Antiochus. And perhaps it had been much more
for the reputation of the Christian commentatore upon the
Book of the Revelations, is they had looked upon chat number,

hundred and sixty days‚” as spoken allusively‚ and not applied

By the way, whilst we are speaking of the persecution
under the Greeks, we cannot but call to mind the story in
the Second Book of Maccab. vii, of the mother and her
seven sone, that underwent so cruel a martyrdom: because
we meet with one very like it, if not the same, only the name
changed.

“ ‘ We¹ are killed all the day long, we are accounted as

consulted both, may give his own judgment. And because
we are now fallen into a comparing of the story in the Mac-
cabees with the Talmudists, let us compare one more in Jose-
phus with one in the same authors.
