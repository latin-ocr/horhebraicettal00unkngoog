34. Choroynqphical century.

Mention is made of a certain temple in Ascalon among
the “ five g more famous temples,-—viz. the temple of Bel in
Babylon, the temple of Nebo in Garsi, of Tiratha in Mapheg‚
of Zeripha in Ascalon, and of Nishra in Arabia.”

And there is a story of a fast enjoined, because some sign
appeared of a blast of the corn in Ascalon: “Theh elders
went down from Jerusalem into their cities, and enjoined a
fast, because so much of a blast was seen in Ascalon, as the
space of the mouth of an oven may contain.”

But most famous of all is the story of the eighty women,
that were witcheS, hanged by Simeon Ben Shetach in one
and the same day. We will not think much to relate the
thing in the words of the Gemarists ἱ ε-“ When as two dis-
ciples of the wise men in Ascalon werek intent upon the
st-udy of the law, one of them, at length dying, had no fune-
rals performed for him—when yet a publican, dying at that
time, had. To the student, that survived, are revealed the

joys of his saved companion‚ and likewise the punishments of
the damned publican.'' &subn :³522 *²737 n: 0⁸50 &nm

English 3 unless my conjecture fail me, it savours of spite
and poison. I should thus render it: “ He saw Mary, the
daughter of Eli, in the shades, hung up by the kernels of the
breasts; and when he inquired‚ How long she was to suffer
those things? it was answered‚ Until Simon Ben Shetach
came to supply her place. But, said he, for what crime? It
is answered‚ Therefore‚ because he sometime swore against
his soul, and said, If I shall ever become a prince, Ι will de-
stroy all wizards. But behold, he is become a prince, and
yet he hath not done this: for eighty women, that are witches,
lie hid in a cave at Ascalon, and kill the world. Go, and tell
him, sae. He went to him, therefore, and related these things,
&a On a certain· rainy day, therefore, having eighty young
men in company with him, he goes to the cave, knoeks, pro-
fesses himself one of the bewitching society, and is let1 in.
He sees them exercising their art. For, mutter-ing certain
words together, one brings morsels of meaa—another, wine,
