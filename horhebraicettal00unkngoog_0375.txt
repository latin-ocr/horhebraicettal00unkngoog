The pool Skelctlch. 365

Now, therefore, here arisoth a question, whether that pool
be the pool of Siloam or no: which as yet bath hardly been
questioned ⁰ by any, and, for some time, not by myself. But
Ι am now apt to think that it was so distinguished betwixt
the two pools‚ that the lower pool retaining its name of the
‘ Pool of Shelahh‚' the upper pool obtained that of ⁶ Siloahh.'

For,

Ι. How otherwise should that distinction of the Greek
version arise, but that the interpreters followed the common
pronunciation of the word Shelahh, when they render it τῶν
κωδίων, of skins.

ΙΙ. Those words of St. John ix. 7, Eis τὴν κολυμβήθραν τοῦ
Σιλωᾶμ, ὃ ἑρμηνεύεται Ἀπεσταλμένος, “ in the pool of Siloam,
which is by interpretation, Sent,'’ seem to intimate that there
were two pools of a very near sonnd, whereof one signified
Ἀπεσταλμένος, Sem, the other not.

Ill. The Jerusalem Talmudists seem to say that the upper
pool was called the ‘ Pool of Siloam' in these words : “ He‘¹
that is unclean by a dead body doth not enter into the mount
of the Temple. It is said that they appear only in the court.
W hence do you mensure? from the wall, or from the houses?
It is Samuel’s tradition, rn‘rwn from Siloam .· now Siloam
was in the midst of the city.”

The question here propounded is, whether 116 that is un·
clean by a dead body may be permitted to enter the Temple:
and the stating of it comes to this, that inquiry be made
within what measure he is to be admitted; whether within
the wall of the Temple, or at that distance where the houses
next to the Temple end; especially where the houses of Si-
loam end.

Now, whereas they say nni-mn mn: τιὴ-ι mbr) that
Siloam ie in the mid-st qf the city, it must by no means be un-
derstood of the fountain itself‚ for that was plainly without
the city; nor yet of the lower pool Shelahh‚ for that also was
without the city, or scarce within it. There ie, therefore, no
third, unless that this upper pool be called ‘ the pool of Si-
loam‚’ and that it give denomination to the adjacent part of
the city, to wit, to the five porches and the buildings about
it: which though they were not in the very centre of the city,
