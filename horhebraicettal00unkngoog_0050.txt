‘⁶ Lydda is a part of J udea.” Let some maps mark this,
which have placed a certain Lod, which never was any where,
not sar from J ericho, asu was said before 3 because Lod, in
the land of Benjamin‚ is brought in, Neh. xi. 35: but they
set Lydda far beyond the bounds of J udea in the land of
Ephraim. “ ·

“ Koshab Bar Ulla¹ sometime got away to Lydda to Rabbi
J osua Ben Levi, dwelling there, when he fled from the Ro-
mans. The Romans pursued him, and besieged the city.
Unless you deliver him to us, say they, we will destroy the
city. R. Josua Ben Levi persuaded him, and he was de-
livered to the Romans.”

I might produce numberless things celebrating the name
of Lydda; such as, 7³³7: m& w: ΠἯζῖζύ, “ They chamber of
Beth-Arum in Lydda.'' '1³52 Πῖἓζῖ w: l'ffiffiy “ The² cham-
ber of Beth-lebam in Lydda.” wib: mm rw: Μῖνι) “ The-⁸
chamber of Beth-Nethaza in Lydda.'’—We suppose these
were schools.

Ι might mention very many names of Rabbins residing at
Lydda, besides those whom Ι have remembered before: such
are, R. Chama Bar Chaninab, and R. Hoshaia with him.
R. Illai ⁰, and R. Eliezer 3 and others, who are vulgarly called
tlte »Son-thern, in the sense we produced before. Concerning
R. Josua Ben Levi, by name, the author of J uchasin hath
these words, *nbi Diu-12 ῚΠΞἾΦἾ “ His d habitation, or college,
was in the south of the land of Israel.” He means Lydda.

R. Eliezer‚ dying at Oaesarea, desired to be buried at
Lydda, whom R. Akibah bewailed as well with blood as
tears. “ Fore when he met his hearse betwixt Caesarea and
Lydda, he beat himself in that manner, that blood flowed
down upon the earth. Lamenfing, thus he spoke,—-O my
father, my father, the chariot and horsemen of Israel. l
have much money, but I want a moneyer, to change it.'’ The
Gloss is this, “ Ι have very many questions; but now there
is no man, to whom Ι may propound them.''

There is a place between J amnia and Lydda, which was
