There is somewhat there als0, which how ιο reconcile with
J osephus, it is not easy to shew: for it is said,

From<¹ Neapolis to AElia 30 miles,

To Eleutheropolis . . . 20 miles,

To Ascalon ..... 24 miles.
Where from AElia or Jerusalem to Ascalon run out only 44
miles 3 whereas J osephus saith of Ascalon, that it was τῶν
Ἱεροσυλύμων εἴκοσι πρὸς τοῖς πεντακοσίοις ἀπέχουσα σταδίους,
“ distante from Jerusalem 520 furlongs,'' or 65 miles. This
breach is a little filled up by this; that New Ascalon was
nearer ιο Jerusalem than the old by sixteen miles, as Ben-
jamin relatos. ’

Whether Betaron were the same with ἾΠἾΞ Betar, where

that horrible slaughter was under Ben Oozba, we will not
disputo here: there is no doubt to be made but Liamnia is

illy writ for Jamnia. And now let us follow Antoninus ιο
Pelusium :—

Rhinocolura

Ostracena . . . 24 miles,
Cassio . . . . 26 miles,
Pentascino . . . 20 miles,
Pelusio . . . . 20 miles.

Which how they agree with Pliny, who numbers only sixty-
five miles srom Pelusium to the ending of Arabia, viz. ιο
the Sirbon, on which Rhinocolura bor-ders, 1 shall not take
upon me to say. This 1 have said elsewhere, that it is a
wonder that some maps should place the Sirbon between
Cassius and Pelusium, when the contrary manifestly appears
both here and in Pliny and Strabo· Perhaps they took the
error from Ptolemy, or at least srom his interpreter, in whom
Cassius is in latitudo, degr. 31· 15 ε but the breaking out of
the Sirbon in 31. ιο.
