180 Choroyraphical century.

J uliae-Bethsaida was not seat-ed in Galilee, as it is in the
maps, but beyond the sea of Galilee in Perea. This we say
upon the credit of J osephus: “ Philip (saith hes) built Cae-
sarea in Paneas„ καὶ ἐν τῇ κάτω Γαυλανιτικῇ Ἰουλιάδα [mark
that]: and J ulias [which before-time was Bethsaida] in Ne-
ther Caulonitis.'’ But now, there is nobody but knows that
Gaulonitis was in Perea. This certainly is that J ulias which
Plinys placeth eastward of the lake of Gennesaret (for the
other J ulias was scarcely near the sea at all); and that «Iulias
of which J osephus speaks, when he saith b, ‘⁶ that a certain
mountainous country beyond Jordan runs out from Julias to
Somorrha.’'

Gamala. Chorazin.

Tuaen things determine the situation of Gamala 2-1, It
was ἐνὶ κάτω Γαυλαυᾷ, “ in lower Gaulon,'' in which, as we
have seen, Bethsaida was. 2. It was ὑπὲρ τὴν λίμνην [Γεννη-
σαρίτιδα]· “ upon the lake [of Gennesaret].” 3. It was Ta-
ριχαιῶν ἀντικρὺς, “ over-against Tarichee.” Compare the
maps, whether in their placing of it they agree with these
passages. Herel‘ was J udas born, commonly called ‘ Gau-
lanites,' and as commonly also, the -‘ Galileam’ So Peter and
Andrew and Philip were Gaulanites3 of Bethsaida, John i.
443 and yet they were called ‘ Galileans.'

While we are speaking of Bethsaida, Chorazin comes into
our mind, which is joined with it, in the words of Christ,
Matt. xi. 21, as pal-taking with it in his miracles, and being
guilty of equal ingratitude. 1f you seek for the situation of
this place, where will you find it? Some maps place it on
this side Jordan, and others beyond Jordan: but on what
authority do both dependi It is mere conjecture, unless I
am deceived. Let me also conjecture.

The¹ word ΓΦἾἸΠ ΟΙιοναεΙιίη, denotes woody places, both
in the Holy Bible and in the Rabbinical writings. Hence
we suppose the Chorazin that is now before us is called,
