But after the war of Adrian, and the death of R.. Akibah in
that war, when J udea was now in disturbance by the Romans,
Rabban Simeon, the son of Gamaliel, succeeding in the pre-
sidentship after Akibah, went with the Sanhedrim from J asne
to Usha, nor was there ever after any return to J afne.

The Talmudists¹ remember us os very many things trans-
acted at Usha. “ When they intercalated the year in Usha,
the first day, R. Ismael, the son of R. J ochanan Ben Brucha,
stood forth, and said according to the words of R. J ochanan
Ben N uri. Rabban Simeon Ben Gamaliel said, ‘ We were not
wont to do so In J asne? On the second day, Ananias, the son
of J osi the Galilean‚ said according to the words ofR Akibah.
R. Simeon Ben Gamaliel said, ‘ So we were wont to do in
J asne? '⁹ This story is repeated in Rosh haehanahk‚ and
Nedarim1.

“ lum Usha it was decreed that a man should nourish his

the Truma, in some doubtful cases: of which see the place
quoted.

But that we be not more tedious, let this story be for a
conclusion: “The‘’ wicked kingdom [of Rome] did sometime
decree a persecution against Israel: namely, that every one
preferring any to be an elder should be killed; and that
every one that was preferred should be killed; and that the
city in which any is preferred to eldership should be laid
waste; and that the borders within which any such promotion
is made, should be rooted out. What did Baba Ben J udah
do? He went out, and sat between two great mountainS, and
between two great citiee, and between two sabbath bounds,

dained five elders, namely, R. Meir‚ R.. J udah, R.. Simeon, R.
J osi, and R. Eliezer Ben Simeon. Rabh Oia added also
R.. Nehemiah. When this came to be known to their enemies,
he said to the scholam, ‘ Fly, Ο my sons ι’ they said to him,
