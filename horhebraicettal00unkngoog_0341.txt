Scor. IV.-Mkya πεδίον· The qroat plain: tlte

scythopolitam passaqo thore.

Or this great plain, whioh took in the whole breadth of
the oountry of Manasseh from Jordan towards the west, a
very long way, J osephus frequently speaks. Describing the
situation and portion of Ephraim and Manasseh, he thus
expresseth himself:

‘H¹ δ’ Ἐφραίμου φυλὴ τὴν ἄχρι Γαδάρων ἀπὸ Ἰορδάνου πο-
ταμοΰ μηκυνομένην ἔλαχεν, εὖρείαν δὲ ὅσον ἀπὸ Βεθήλων εἰς τὸ
μέγα τελευτᾷ πεδίον· “ The tribe of Ephraim extended itself
in length from the river Jordan ιο Gadara” [Gezer-ah, or
Gezer, J osh. xvi. 3, and xxi. 21]; “ in breadth, from Bethel,
and ends at the Great Plainx’

Τῆς Μανασσήτιδος 01 ἡμίσεις, διο. “ The half tribe of Ma-
nasseh extends itself in longitude from Jordan ιο the city
Dor. Πλάτος δὲ ἐπὶ Βηθσάνων, ἦ νῦν Σκυθόπολις καλεῖται· But
in latitudo [from Ephraim] it machoth to Beth-show, which is
now called Scythwolief So that that μέγα πεδίον, or ‘ great
plain‚' to those that were journeying from Galilee‚ began from
Beth-shean, and extended itself in latitude ιο the confines of
Ephraim. Henoe that which we meet with in the same J o-
sephus, Ἧκον “¹ εἰς τὸ μέγα πεδίον, οὗ κεῖται κατὰ τὸ πρόσωπον
πόλις Βηθσάνη· “ They that passed over Jordan eame into
the great plain, before which the city Bethsan lies ;” or as
it is in 1 Maec. v. 52, “ They went over Jordan into the
great plain before Beth-shean.”

In the Book of J udith, ohap. i. 8, it is called τὸ μέγα πεδίον
Ἐσδρηλῶμ· “The great plain of Esdrelom :” that is, in truth,
‘⁶ the great valley of J ezreel.” So Jezreel, in the plaoe above
quoted, 1 Kings iv. 12, by the Greek interpretem is rendered
Ἐσραέ. Insomuoh, that when it is said of J udah and his
army (for he it is whom this passage oonoerns), that in his
return from the land of Gilead he passed over Jordan into
this ‘⁸ great plain,” and that (as it should seem) not very far
from Beth-shean3 it is evident that the great and common
passage over Jordan was hereabout ¹², by which not only the
scythopolitam went over from their oountry on this side
