Machoerm, α cattle. 347

τοῦ. “ Ηο fortified a eastle upon a hin towards Arabia, and
called it Heredium, after himself. '' Where, by Arabia,
you are to understand the land of Moab‚· and he seemed
to have fortified that oastle, as a bulwark against the Moab-
itish Arabs.

The same Herod that built it is buried there, as the same
J osephus tells ush; where, deseribing the funeral pomp, he
gives this account: Πεντακόσιοι δὲ ὑπ’ αὐτοῖς τῶν οἰκετῶν καὶ
ἀπελευθέρων ἀρωματοφόροι, “ After those followed five hundred
of his own· domestic servants, beariny apices. Σταδίους δὲ
ἐκομίσθη τὸ σῶμα διακοσίους εἰς Ἥρῶδιον, ὅπου κατὰ τὰς ἑντολᾶς
ἐτάφη· His body was brouyht two hundred furlouyff' [from
Jerieho where he died] to Heredium, where, aeoorch‘nq to
his own appointment, he was iuteo-red. But, in Antiq. lib.
xvii. cap. 105, Ἤιεσαν δὲ ἐπὶ Ἡρωδίου στάδια ὀκτώ· “ They
came to Heredium eiqlat furton933 for there he had ordered
his funeral solemnities.” At first sight, here is an appearance
of a slip in history: but. it is to be understood, that from
J erieho to Heredium it was two hundred furlongs, that ie,
twenty-five miles; but Herod's burying-plaee was eight fur..
longs from Heu-odium, a common distance for burying-plaees
to be from eitieS.

Sac‘r. VLk-Maolzaem, a castle.

J osapnus¹ tells us, that John Baptist was imprisoned by
Herod in the eastle of Maehaerus: Καὶ ὀ μὲν, ὑποψίᾳ τῇ Ἡρό-
δου, δέσμιος εἷς τὴν Μαχαιροῦντα πεμφθεὶς, &a “ He [tho Bap—
tizt]‚ upon Herod’s suspicion, is sent prisoner to Maehaerus.''
A little before that he had told ue, μεθόριον δέ ἐστι τῆς τε
Ἀρέτα, καὶ Ἡρώδου ἀρχῆς· This place “is the frontier betwixt
the kingdom of Aretes [tho Arabiam kiny] and Herod.”

Of the situation of the place, Pliny m hath this hint3
‘⁶ Prospioit [Asphaltitin] ab oriente Arabia Nomadum [Moab-
itis] .· a meridie Machaerus, secunda quondam Arx J udaeae
ab Hierosolymis.'’ The meaning of which is this3 ‘⁶ that
