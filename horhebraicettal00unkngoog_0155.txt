saret, stretehed out also [in length] to Carmel and the sea.”
On the south, the land of Zebulon was bounded by that os
lambat, extending iteels in breadth μέχρι Γευυησαρίτιδος, “ to
Gennesaret :” touehing only upon Gennesaret, not eompre-
· hending Gennesaret within it. So the same J osephus speaks
in the plaee alleged, that Νεφθαλίται παρέλαβον τὰ πρὸς τὰς
ἀνατολὰς τετραμμένα μέχρι Δαμασκοῦ πόλεως, “ the men of
Naphtali took those parts that ran out eastwardly unto the
oity of Damasous.” It would be ridiculous‚ if you should so
render μέχρι Δαμασκοῦ πόλεως, “ unto the eity of Damascus,’'
as to include Damascus within the land of Naphtali. 'Phe maps
are guilty of the like solecism, while they make Zebulon‚ which
only came μέχρι Γενυησαρίτιὸος, “ unto the lake of Gennesaret‚''
to oomprise all the lake of Gennesaret within it. Look into

Adriohomius, to say nothing of others, and compare these
words of J osephus with him.

Hither perhaps is that to be reduced, which hath not a
little vexed interpreters in J osh. xix; where Jordan is twice
mentioned, in defining the limits of the tribe of N aphtali ·
ver. 33, “the outgoings of the border,” henoe‚‘ ‘was to J or

dan;” and, ver. 34, &nvp ΠἾῖζ) FNP! Uva-'1⁵25‘ ‘The
going out from thence [that' is, from the south border] was to
Jordan 1n J ndah towards the sun· -risingff'

What hath the land os Naphtali to do with Jordan in
J udah Ξ

I answer, J udah, that is, J udea, is here opposed to Galilee:
J ndah is not here spoken of as opposed to the other tribes.
Before ever the name of Samaria was risen, the name of
Galilee was very well known, Josh. xx. 73 and so was the
name of J udea: and at that time one might not improperly
divide the whole land within Jordan into Galilee and J udea:
when as yet there was no such thing as the name of Samaria.
'Phe words alleged, therefore, oome to this sense, as if it had
been said, ‘ The north bounds of Naphtali went out east-
wardly to Jordan in Galilee: in like manner the south bonnds
went out eastwardly to Jordan now running into J udea ς’ that
is, the country without Galilee, whioh as yet was not called
Samaria, but rather J udea.

The bounds, oertainly‚ os the land os Naphtali seem to
touch Jordan on both sides, both on the north and the south;
