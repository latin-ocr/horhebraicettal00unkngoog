 

The noted passayes over Jordan. 329

and common passages that led over that river from one
country into another.

Ι. There is a bridge over Jordan f, betwixt the lake of
Samochon and Gennesaret in the 'way that leadeth to Da-
mascus, which hath the name of “ J acob's bridge ;'' of which
our countryman Biddulph, who bath himself travelled over it,
speaks to this purpose:

‘⁶ At the foot of this rocky mountain runs a pleasant
river called Jordan, which divideth Syria from Galilee. Over
this river is built a goodly bridge, which bears the name of
‘ Jacob's bridge,’ upon this twofold account: 1. Because in
this place Jacob met with his brother Esau; 2. Because here
he wrestled with the angel.”

As to matter of fact, that there is and was such a bridge,
Ι do not much question; but for the reasons why it is so
called, as it is not much to our purpose to examine, so they
seem to have little else but conjecture in them.

II. Jordan also had a bridge over it at ohammath‚ near
Tiberias, at the very effiux of the river out of the sea of Gen-
nesaret; as we have elsewhere shewn from the Talmudic
authors, against the mistake of the tables, which place Ti-
berias at a great distance thence. ‘⁶ Tam Β Dominus Rex
quam Principes omnes, Tiberiadem usque perveniunt, ubi
circa pontem, unde ex mari J ordanis fluenta se dividunt,
castrametatur? i. e. ‘⁶ As well the lord the king, as all the
princes, come even unto Tiberias, and pitoh their tents near
the bridge, where the streams of Jordan from the sea do
divide themselves.''

“ J uxtah Tiberiadem secus pontem, unde de lacu eonem,
J ordanis fluenta se dividunt, cum exercitu sua castra locavit :’'
i. e. ‘⁶ With his army he pitohed his tents near Tiberias, by
the bridge, from whence the streams of Jordan, from the
lake of Gennesaret, do divide themselves.'’ Read this, and
view the situation of Tiberias in* the tables, and correct the
mistake.

111. That was a most known and frequent passage from
J ericho, which we so often read of in the Holy Scriptures3
