Heauhfid Palatino. 209

know not, if not in this our Idumea. It is not indeed to
be dissembled, that, in the Notitia Imperii, in the scheme
adorned with the pictures of the Roman garrisons‚ Jordan is
painted running between them, five being placed on this side,
and eight on that. So that it may seem that the country
beyond Jordan was the third part. But 1 shall not disputo
here, whether that be not in part to be disposed under the
governor of Syria or Arabia; but there are some things
which seem to favour such an opinion, partly in the Notitia
itself, but especially in the authors alleged.

If, therefore, I may be allowed my conjecture concerning
this New Idumea, then some answer may be given about the
Sanhedrims of both Palestines, in the meantime not denying
the threefold division of it. We must consider, indeed, that
there were councils or Sanhedrims in the times of Theodosius
and Valentiniana, «Sto. They were, in times past, in that Pales-
tine whose head was Caesarea, and in that Palestine whose
head was Jerusalem: but not in that Idumea concerning
which we speak, whose head, whether ye state it to be Gaza
or Ascalon, or Eleutheropolis, concerning which J erome se

often speaks, and perhaps Bereshith Babba ², we do not
define.

Mention indeed occurs in the Talmudists of ΠἹἾἿ Ὃρτ and
’ἉὩἸἾἾ “ The southern Rabbins ;” but not so called, because
they dwelt in the furthest southern parts of J udea‚ for those
os Jafne and Lydda had that name, but because J udea was
south of Galilee. For the Rabbins of Tiberias give them
that title.

But, whatsoever at last that ‘ Third Palestine’ was, no less
scruple arises why it was called ‘ Salutaris: the ‘ Healthful.'
Pancirolus will have it to be from ·the wholesome waters:
and he learned· from Sozomen ⁸, that they ran from Emmaus
into J udea, namely, that fountain where Christ washed his
disciples’ feet: “ from whence the water (to use his words),
facta est diversarum medicamen passionum, became medicinal
for divers distempers.”

But besides that that story savours enough of sablo, the

word Emmaus, if Ι may be judge, deceived its first author,
which indeed sometimes is written for Ammaue, denoting
