2 Sam. xx. 18, discussed. 307

things have failed which the faithful of lsrael laid up. Asking
they will ask in Abel, and so if they have failed.”

If any one ean make any tolerable sense of these words,
he would do well to teaeh others how to do it too ς especially
let them tell the reason why Dan should be added here. lt
is true Dan and Abel-beth-maaehah are mentioned together
as not very distant from one another, ι Kings xv. 20: and
if we do by the words understand their neighbourhood to
one another, 1 see nothing else that ean be picked out of
them.

However, both the Roman and Alexandrian editions agree
in this reading, whieh have the preference of all other
editions of the Greek version. And let them now, who
are for eorrecting the Hebrew Bibles by the Greek, say,
whether they are for having them corrected here3 only let
them give me leave to enjoy the Hebrew text as we now
have it.

The Hebrew makes the sense plain, if the first words

ΠΞἽΦΝἿᾉ ᾈἾᾏῬ, ἾᾈἹ be but rightly applied, namely‚ to
Sheba and his party speaking; “When Sheba and his fol-
lowers eame hither, they at first eertainly said thus, That
they would ask Abel of its peace, or on whose side it waS,

morgi lm and so they made tlte matter entire,'’ or made a
show of their own integrity. For that that J oab was ehiefly
to be satisfied in, was, that this eity had not taken part with
the conspirator-33 which is direetly done, if we admit this
sense and interpretation of the words. This prudent woman
assures him, that “ those of Abel had by no means invit-ed
Sheba and his fellow-rebels into their town, or by any consent
with them in their rebellione, would ever willingly have
admitted them3 but that they were miserably deeeived by
their fawning and false words, while they only pretended to
inquire about the peaee and well-being of that eity: and
that you may know more effectually that all this is true

whieh Ι now affirm to you, we will immediately throw you
the head of Sheba over our wall.”
