Beth-lehem.

Tim Jews are very silent about this city z nor do Ι remember
that I have read any thing in them concerning it, besides
those things which are produced out of the Old Testament3
this only excepted, that the Jerusalem Gemarists ¹¹ do confess
that the Messias was born there before their times.

Βηθλεέμῡ κῶμη τίς ἐστιν ἐν τῇ χώρᾳ Ἰουδαίων, ἀπέχουσα
σταδίους τριακονταπέντε Ἱεροσολύμων· “ Beth-lehem is a certain
town in the land of the Jews, thirty-five furlongs distant from
Jerusalem θ’ and that towards the south.

The father of the ecclesiastical annals, citing these words
of EusebiuS, Ἀκμήο-αντοςΡ δὲ τοῦ πολέμου ἔτους ὀκτωκαιδεκά·
του τῆς ἡγεμονίας Ἀδριανοῦ κατὰ Βήθηκα πόλιν, {dvm thus ren·
ders them in Latin; “Jamq vero, cum, decimo octavo anno
imperii Hadriani, bellum, juxta urbem Beth-lehem nuncu·
patam (quae erat rerum omnium praesidiis munitissima, neque
adeo longe a civitate Hierosolymamm sita) vehementius ac·

of the empire of Adrian, the war was more vehemently kin-

fortified with all manner of defence, nor was seated far from
the city of J erusalem)‚'' διο.

The interpreter of Eusebius renders Βήθηκα, Beth-thera:
not illy, however it be not rendered according to the letter:
perhaps κ crept into the word instead of ρ, by the careless-
ness of the copiers. But by what libert-y the other should render
it Beth-lehem, let himself see. Eusebius doth certainly treat
of the city ἾῙἾἾΞ, Betar (it is vulgarly written Biuer), of
the destruction of which the Jews relate very many things
