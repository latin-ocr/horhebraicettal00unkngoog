Sirbon lake. The towns of Rhinocorura, and within Raphea.
Gaza, and within Anthedon. ‘Mount Augai-is. The country
along the coast, Samaria. The free town Ascalon, Azotus.
The two J amnes, the one a village'’ (otherwise J amne within).
‘⁸ J oppe of the Phoenicians. Thence Apollonia. The tower
of Strat03 the same is Caesarea. The bounds of Palestine are
a hundred and eighty-nine miles from the confines of Arabia.
Then begins Phoenice.'’

And chap. xix: “ We must go back to the coast, and
Phoenice. There was the town Crocodilon ; it is now a river.
Ruins of some cities. Dorum. Sycaminum. The promontory
Carmel: and, in the mountain, a town of the same name,
heretofore called Ecbatana. Near that, Getta, Lebba‚ the
river Pagida or Belus, mingling glassy sand - with its small
shore: it flows from the lake Cendevia, at the root of Carmel.
Next that is Ptolemais, a colony of Claudius Gaesar, which
heretofore was called Ace. The town Ecdippa. The White
Promontory. Tyrus, heretofore an island, 819. It is in com·
pass nineteen miles, Palae-Tyro, lying within, being included.
The town itself contains two-and-twenty furlongs. Then the
towns, Euhydra‚ Sarepta, and Ornithon 3 and Sidon, the artist
of glasS, and the mother of Thebes in Boeotia.”

« strabos goes backward: Διέχει δὲ τῆς Σιδόνος ἦ Τύρος οὗ
πλείους τῶν διακοσίων σταδίων· “ Tyrus is not distant from Sidon
above two hundred furlongs :”—five-and-twenty miles.

The masters of t-he Jews have observed this neighbour-
hood in that canon, whereby provision is made, that nobody
betake himself to sail in the Mediterranean sea within three
days before the sabbath: “But if any (say theyh) will sail
from Tyre to Sidon, he may, even on the eve of the sabbath:
because it is welli known, that that space may be sailed,
while it is yet day.''

'Ev τῷ μεταξὺ πολίχνιον, ὀρνίθων πόλις λεγομένη. “ Between
'Pyre and Sidon there is the little city Ornithon ” (the city of
birds). “ At Tyre a river goes out.'’

“ Thirty fui-longs beyond Tyre is Palae-Tyrus :³⁹ three miles
three quarters. When, therefore, Pliny saith, the compass of
'Pyre is nineteen miles, “ Palae-Tyre, that lies within, being
included,” he shows manifestly, that it is not to be understood
