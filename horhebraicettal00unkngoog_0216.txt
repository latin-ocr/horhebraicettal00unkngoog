Rhinocorura‚ and Raphia Inwards. Sometimes also in the
Holy Scripture it is called Shur3 and instead of it, iu those
interpretem, it is called ‘Chagra.' Whence is the name of
mount Angaris concerning which Pliny speaks,—“ Gaza, and
inwards Anthedon, mount Angaris.” For when the Syrians
pronounced ‘ Ohaggara,' the Greeks would sound a double
Gramma by n and 9, and would say ‘ ΑΗΒ-πα]

Shur also is sometimes rendered by the eastern inter-
preters ΠΒἸῙῬΠ matamala, as the Jerusalem Targum upon
Gen. xvi. 73 and Jonathan upon Exod. xv. 22. The Arabio
so renders Gerarim, Gen. xx. 1 ; and J onathan, Bared, Gen.
xvi. 14. Bared indeed, which signifies haic, you call in Greek
χάλαζαι and whether the Targumists use the Greek word,
when they render it Chaluzah, let the reader judge.

Shur, sometimes in the Syriae interpreter, is ἾἸΨ Sud, as
Exod. gv. 22 ; the point for difference in t-he last letter being
placed amiss. In Gen. xvi. 7, 14, Shur and Bao-ed are ren-
dered by them Gadar, instead of Gerar, by the same error.
Bared in the Arabio is Jared there, with two points placed
under the first letter instead of one.

The country of the Avites, call it by what name you will,
ended at Gaza, being stretched out thither in length, from
the river of Egypt, fortyd'our miles. But the Idumea which
we seek ended not there, but extended itself farther into
J udea, swallowing up, under the name, that whole breadth of
the land, from the Mediterranean sea to the sea of Sodom‚
according to the length of it.

Snc‘r. VL—le whole portion qs Simeon within Idumea.

11- swallowed up, first, the whole portion of Simeon, a
great part of which was contained within the country of the
Avites3 but not a small part also extended itself farther into
J udea. Mention is made of his ‘ fourteen cities‚' J osh. xix.
if you tell them one by one; but they are said to be only
thirteen, ver. 6 ; where the LXX make an even number, while
they take ῙζϊηἾϊῤ Sharuhm, not for a city, but render it, Οἱ

ἀγροὶ αὐτῶν, as if they had read ζζῐὛἾὶζ.) ‘ their fields.' But-
Sheba seems rat-her to be one and the same with Beersheba ;
and so the number is made equal.
