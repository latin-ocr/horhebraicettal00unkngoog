Ἀληθῶς καὶ σὺ ἐξ αὐτῶν εἴ· καὶ γὰρ ἦ λαλία σου δῆλόν σε
ποιεῖ· “ Surely thou also art one of them, for thy speech be-
wrayeth thee‚'' Matt. xxvi. 73. Let these passages, which are
delivered by the masters, be instead of a comment :—

“ Toi the men of Judea who were exact in their language‚
their law is established in their hands. To the men of
Galilae, who were not exact in their language‚ their law is
not established in their hands.”—-The 61033 is, “ They [the
men of J udea] were exact in their langnagez so that their
speech was pure, not corrupt.'’

‘⁴ To the men of J udea, who are exact about their lan-
guage, and appoint to themselves certain signs, their law is
established in their hands: to the men of Galilee‚ who are
not exact about their language‚ nor appoint to themselves
signs, their law is not established in their hands.” The
61033 is; '' They were exact about their lang-uage, namely‚
in rendering the same words which they had heard from
their masters. And because they were taught orally, by
hearing after hearing, they appointed to themselves from
them sign after sign. And because they were exact about
their language, they knew how to appoint to themselves fit
signs that they might not forget.’'

“ The men of Judea learn from one master, and their law
is established in their hands: the Galileans learn not from
one master, and their law is not established in their hands.”
The 61033 writes, “ The Galileans heard one master in 000
language, and another in another3 and the diversity of the
language, or pronunciation‚ confounded them so that they
sorgat.'’ And a little after,

‘⁴ R. Abba said, If any ask the men of J udea, who are
exact about their langnage, pn ΓἾἎΝὮ 3& pn paam
Whether they say ΓὊΏΌ Μααόνίη with ῃ (Ain), or ῙἾἾΞΏὉ

(with Ain), or mn& Aouzo (with Aleph)3 Theyk will answer‚
There are some who pronounce it ΓἾἎΝὉ (with Aleph)‚ and
