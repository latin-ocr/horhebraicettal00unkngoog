Lydda. 39

phon at Lydda. We read¹ also of a fast enjoined at Lydda
for the obtaining of rain, and Tarphon the moderator of the
solemnity. The stories of this plaoe are infinite: we will

gather a few.
Helena m the queen celebrated the feast of tabernaeles at

ΥΒ.. Eliezar ¹¹ and R. J oshua were sometime present in the
same plaoe at the feast of dedication: but being not enough
satisfied oonoerning the fast at that time enjoined, one went
to the bath‚—the other, to the barber’s shop.

Here ⁰ it wa8‚ that Ben Satdah was surprised and taken,
and brought before the Sanhedrim, and stoned.

There is also very frequent mention of Papus and Lulienus,
brethren, slain at Lydda by the Roman kingdom: “ Ther> day
ζἸἾἾἾο ἰ8 the day wherein Lulienus and Papus were slain.'' ῘἸἾἾἾΔ
with the Jerusalem writers is ΟἹἎἾἾἾἸῑο with the Babylonian:
who relate. that these brethren were slain wmwlvn, “inq Lao-
dicea‚'' as one would guess. But ΓΡἾἹΒ, saith the Gloss, ‘⁸ is
Lydda: forr '1²:³7 ἿᾸἸἾΠ, the slain of Lydda are every where
mentioned—And these (saith the Gloss) were put to death
for the king’s daughter, who was found slain; and there was
a rumour the Jews had killed her. When, therefore, a sharp
deeree was deereed against the Jews, these two stood forth,
and delivered Israel. For they said, We slew her: therefore,
the king put them only to death.'’

Since ⁹ it was not lawful to intercalate the year any where
but in Jndea, ‘⁴ at great many went to Lydda out of the sehool
of the Rabbi'’ (J udah Haccodesh‚ viz. out of Galilee), ‘⁴ that
they might intere-alate : but a certain evil eye met them, and
they all died together. After that, they removed the inter-
calation of the year out of J udea into Galilee.” And a little
after: “ R.. Jeremiah asked before R. Zeira, Is not Lydda a
part of J adea! Yes, saith he. Wherefore, then, do they not
transaet the intercalation of the year there i—Beeause they
are obstinate, and unskilful in the law.''
