sacrifices without the Temple of God, and instituted rites out
of their own heart. In that Temple, Manasseh, the son-in-
law of Sanballat‚ the son of Joshua, the son of J ozedek the
high-priest‚ performed tho priest's office. And at that time
Zadok and.Baithus‚ the scholare of Antigonae, did flourish;
and hence was the beginning of the schism; — namely‚
when, in the days of Antigonus, many went back to mount
Gerizim.’'

Thaty Temple flourished about two hundred years, and²
it perished by the sword and fire of Hyrcanus: but the Sa-
maritan superstition perished not, but lasted for many ages;
as odious to the Jews as heathenism, John iv. 9. Yet they
confess that ΠἾῚΠΖΩ ΟἿΠἹΞ vn& the ὃ land <ff the Sa-
maritam was clean, and their fountains clean, and their
dwellings clean, and their paths clean.” But much dispute is
made about their victuale, in the place noted in the margin.
“R. Jacob Bar Acha in the name of R. Lazar saith, ‘ The
victuale of the Outheans are lawful,’ which is to be understood
of that food with which their wine and vinegar is not mingled.
It is a tradition. They sometimes said, Why is the wine of
Uydor [ἾῚἾἎἸᾺ] forbidden? Because of [its marum to] Caphar
Pagash. Why the wine of Burgatha? Because of Birath
Sorika. Why the wine of En Cushith 2 Because of Caphar
Salama. But they said afterward, If it be open, it is every
where forbidden ς if it be covered, it is lawful.” And a story
concerning R. Simeon Ben Lazar follows3 who came into a
certain city of the samaritane, and a certain Samaritan scribe
came to him; from whom when he asked something to drink‚
and it was set before him, ῬΙἋ) mm& “ he doubted about
it,'' &c. And other things to that purpose are read not
much after: *wanno ¹72: &nnn mrum* κ’) No wine
was found in all Samaria, on a certain eve of the sabbath,
but, in the end of the sabbath, there was abundanee; for the
Syrians had brought it, and the Samaritans received it of
them‚” &a

pigeons of women after child-birth, &c. “Rabbi⁴'³ said, ‘ A
