ἀποκευτούυτωυ· something obscure. Many conjecture this
gate was called the ‘ Fish·gate‚' because fish were carried
into the city through it ε I rather, because it was the ‘ fish-
market τ’ as the sheep-gete was the market for sheep. Ze-
phaniah addeth, ηέῴῳῃ l‘? Πξξη ‘⁶ And he shau howl from

the second.” The Chaldee reads, &my l⁷23 R. Solomon,
l'l'lfflyo'l 'lym ‘ from the Bird-gate :' perhaps the gate‚ near
unto which fowls were sold. Kimchi reads, &¹709 ἴῃ ‘ from
Ophel ς’ more plain indeed,—but I ask, whether more true?
This 1 Bird-gate perhaps was that which is called the Old-
gate, Neh. iii. 6.

Near the corner, looking south -west, we suppose, the
fountain of Siloam was3 and that, partly, being persuaded
ΒΥ the words of J osephus before alleged‚—partly, being in-
duced to it ΒΥ reason itself. For hence flowed that fountain

the north into the valley, and ends, at length, in the pool of
Siloam, at the foot of mount Sion.

On the west was, 1. ΝῚΖῙΠ 'ww “ The gate of the valley‚”

gate‚'’ ver. 153 not that of Siloam, nor of Draco; but an-
other.

And now we are come to the pool of Siloam, and to the
foot of Sion, whither they went up by certain steps, ver. 15.
The pool of Siloam was first a fountain, and a river, on the
west, without the walls: but at last, Manasseh the king en-
closed all, 2 Chron. xxxiii. 14, that the city might be more
secured of water, in case of a siege: taught it ΒΥ the ex-
ample of his grandfather Hezekiah, but more incommodious,
2 chron. xxxii. 3.

The wall went forward along “ burying-places of David,
another pool, and the House of the strong,” ver. 16. And,

not much after it, bended eastwardly.—And now we are come
to the north side. See ver. 19, 20.

At the turning of this corner, Herod built the most famous
