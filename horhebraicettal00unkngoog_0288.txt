none: therefore the Canaanites betook themselves thither3
and being found not only empty, but conferred by lot upon

But what then shall we say of Melchizedek, whom now
all acknowledge for Sheml Which is more probable, that he
intruded among the Canaanites‚ now inhabiting the land, or
that they int-ruded upon him? Was not that land hereditat-y
to him and his, rather than usurped by wrong and intrusion3
And did not he, by the direction of the Spirit of God, betake
himself thither, rather than either that he, wandering about
uncertainly‚ lighted upon that land by chance, or, acted by a.
spirit of ambition or usurpatiou, violently possessed himself
of it? For my part, I scarcely believe, either that the
Canaanites went thither before the confusion of tongues, or
that Shem, at that time, was not there: but that he had long
and fully inhabited the land of Canaan (as it was afterward
called), before the entrance of the Ganaanites into it: and
that by the privilege of a divine grant, which had destined
him and his post-erity hither: and that afterward the Oa-
naanites crept in here; and were first subjecte to the family
of Shem, whose first-born was Elam, but· at length shook off
the yoke.

When, therefore, all those original natione, from the con-
fusion of tongues, partook of their names immediately from
the fathers of their stock; as, the Assyrians from Assur, the
Elamites from Elam. &c.; the same we must hold of the
Hebrew nation‚ namely, that it, from that time, was called
Hebrew from Heber: and that it was called the land of the
Hebrews, before it was called the land of the Canaanites.
For 1 can neither think that the stock of the Hebrews had
no name for almost three hundred years after the confusion
of ‘ tongues, until the passing of Abraham out of chaldea
found a name for it, which some would have3 nor methinks
is it agreeable that Abraham was therefore called Hebrew,
because, travelling out of Chaldea into the land of canaan,

he passed [5322] Euphrates; when, upon the same reason,
both Oanaau himself, and the fathers of all the western na-
tions almost, should be called Heba-ems,- for they passed over
Euphrates, travelling out of Chaldea. And when the pa-
triarch Joseph himself is called by his mistress a “ Hebrew
