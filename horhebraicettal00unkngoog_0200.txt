the palm-troes qs tlte mountain qs iron aro fit to make a small
bundle to carry in the hand in the feast of Tabernacles y. On
the east coast of Perea was also Σιδηροῦν ὄρος, “ an iron
mountain‚”- witness J osephus 2. And without doubt there
were other such-like mines, scattered here and there in other
parts of that land, though of them we have no mention.

You will not at all wonder at these underminings of the
earth, seeing they brought so much profit and gain with
them, and were so necessary to the life of man. But what
shall we say of those dens and caves in rocks and mountains‚
whence no gain seemed to be digged, but rather danger arose
to the neighbouring places oftentimes? For what were these,
but lurking·places for wild beasts and robbers? There is in·
finite mention of these caves both in the Holy Scriptures and
in other writingS, especially in J osephus, where ὑπόνομοι, and
σπήλαια, subterraneam passayos, and dem, are mentioned a
thousand 1111199. And many of these were of 8 1891 large-
ness‚ scarcely to be credited3 those especially in the Tal-
mudists, which are called ‘⁶ Τ119 dens of Zedekiah,” not a
few miles in distance.

But were those hollows the work of nature, or of the
hands and industry of man? By one example, taken out of
J osephus‚ the thing may be determined. Relating the story
of 8 089119 built by Hyrcanus in Perea, among other things
119 speaks thus ε Ἐκ δὲ τῆς κατ’ ἀντικρὺ τοῦ ὅρους πέτρας διατε-
μὼν αὐτῆς τὸ προέχον, σπήλαια πολλῶν σταδίων τὸ μῆκος κα·-
τεσκεύασεν· “ 0111ει of the rock against the mountain, having
cut in two the prominent parts of it, 119 made dens of many
furlongs long.'' And 8 little after, Τὰ μέντοι στόμια τῶν
σπηλαίων, ‹zo-reb ἕνα δι’ αὐτῶν εἰσιέναι, καὶ μὴ πλείους, βραχύτερα
ἤνοιξε· “ He made the mouths that opened into these dens
to be 911811, that but one might go in at 8 111119, and no
more :” καὶ ταῦτ’ ἐπίτηδες, ἀσφαλείας ἕνεκα, τοῦ μὴ πολιορκηθεὶς
