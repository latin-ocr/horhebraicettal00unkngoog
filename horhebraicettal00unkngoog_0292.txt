Rncxon the sons of Ganaan in Gen. ¹3 and where do you
find the Perizzites3 And yet, a matter to be wondered at,
they are always ‘number-ed in that blaok catalogue os the
seven nations to be cut off.

I know it is supposed by some that they are called Periz-
zites, as much as to say villayers, because they dwelt in vil-
layes, and small towns unfortified: which, indeed, varies not
much from the derivation of the word: but certainly it is
needless, when all the Canaanitish families are reckoned up,
which possessed the whole land, to add tho villaqers over
and above, who were sufficiently included in the aforesaid
reckoning.

But that which we know was done by the Israelites‚ we
justly suppose was done by the Oanaanites also; namely, that
some families of the Oanaanite stook were denominated, not
from the very immediate son of Ganaan, from whom they
derived their original, but from some famous and memorable
man of that stook. Nor do we say this upon conjecture
alone, but by very many examples among the Israelites3 and,
indeed, among other nations, and this in that very nation of
which we are speaking. In Gen. xxxvi, Zibeon was the son
of Scir, ver. 205. and the whole nation and land was called,
‘⁴ The nation and land of the sons of Seir.'' But now that
that Seir was of the Oanaanite pedigree, appears sufficiently
hence, that his son Zibeon was called a Hivite, ver. 2. After
the same manner therefore as the Seirites, who were of
Canaanite blood, were so named, Ι make no doubt the Periz-
zites were «named from one Perez, a man of great name in

some Ganaanite stock.
