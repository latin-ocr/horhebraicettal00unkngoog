1⁷20 East Gato ῳ( the Gom. 69
The Levites ⁰, with harps, lyres‚ cymbals, trumpets, and in·- .

finite other musical instrumenta stood upon the fifteen steps -

going down out of the Oourt of Israel into the Women’s
Oourt, singing according to the number of the fifteen psalrns
of degree& &c.

The east gate of the court of Israel was called the “ gato
of Nicanor.”—“ All Ρ the gates were changed to be of gold,
except the gate of N icanor3 because concerning that a mi-
racle was shown: others say, because the brass os it did ex-
ceedingly shine.”

In q the gato of Nicanor, they made the suspected wife
drink the bitter waters ; they purified the woman after child-
birth, and the leper.

Of the miracle‚ done about the folding-doors of this gato,
see Constantine L'Empereur‚ Middoth, p. 57, and Juchasin,
fol. 65. 2, &c.; who also produceth another reason of the
name, in these words : “ In the book of J osephus Ben Gorion
it is said, that the gato of Nicanorr was so called, because a
miracle was there shown, namely‚ that there they slew Nica-
nor, a captain of the Grecians, in the days of the Asmoneans ε
which may also be seen in the end of the second chapter of
the tract Taanithf’,

The history alleged is thus :—Nicanor³ was one of the
captains of the Greeks; and every day he wagged his hand
towards J udea and Jerusalem, and said, “ Oh ! when will it
be in my power, to lay them waste !” But when the As-
monean family prevailed‚ they subdued them, and slew

, him, and hung up his thumbs and great toes upon the gates

of Jerusalem. Hence ‘ Nicanor’s day’ is in the J ewish ca-
len'gltist gato was πεντήκοντα πηχῶν τὴν ἀνάστασιν, &c., ‘ fifty
cubits in height 3' the doors contained forty cubits, and ve‘i'y
richly adorned with silver and gold, laid on to a great
thllyffletszlsiat gate sat a council of three and twenty; as there

was another in the gate of Susan.
