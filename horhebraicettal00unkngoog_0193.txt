place! Indeed, the Sanhedrim of R. J ochanan was in J abneh ς
but his consistory, ὊἾἾ ΠἮ his seat qs judyment, seems to
be distinguished from the Sanhedrim. So Pau] was brought
up at the feet of Rabban Gamalie13 not in his Sanhedrim,
but '2:³7 rwna in kin consistory or school. So you may
conjecture, that Rabban J ochanan, besides that he sat presi-
dent of the chief Sanhedrirm had his peculiar consistory in
J abneh itself, or in some neighbour place.

That which follows, “ A tradition, the sound of mills, ''
Sne. is cleared by the Glossers: “ The sound of mills in
Burni was 8 sign that there was 8 circumcision there; as if
it had been publicly proclaimed, The infant’s week expires in
this place. And the sound of 8 mill was a sign that spices
were ground to be applied to the wound of the circumcision.
It was 8 time of persecution, wherein it was forbidden to
circumcise: they feared, therefore, by any public notice to
make known that there was to be 8 circumcision; but they
appointed this sign.’' .

‘ A candle in Beror Ohel.'—The Gloss writes, “ The light
of one candle in the day-time, but many candles burning in
the night, gave 8 sign, 88 if one had given notice by 8 public
proclamation that a feast of circumcision was there,'’ 880.

Another 61088 ἰ8 thus: “ They were wont to light candles
at a circumcision. It was also 8 custom to spread 8 table-
cloth at the· door: hence is that, A custom prevailed at J eru-
salem, that 88 long 88 the tablecloth was spread at the door,
travellers went in.'’

The Aruch writes thus3 “ In‘ the time of persecution
they could not celebrate public matrimony, nor public cir-
cumcision3 therefore, they did them secretly: wheresoever,
therefore, were lighted candles on the lintel of the door, they
knew that there was 8 wedding-feast there; and wheresoever
was the sound of mills, there was 8 circumcision.'’

that custom ceased not.”
