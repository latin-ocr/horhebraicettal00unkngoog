Midland Pltoenicia. 249

reckoned all one, 1 am in doubt. 1 had rather divide Phoe-

nicia into three parts, namely‚ into Phoenicia on the sea
coast, Midland Phoenicia, and Syrophoenicia. And the rea-
son is, because Ι ask whether all Midland Phoenicia might
be called Syrophoenicia: and I ask, moreover, whether all
Syrophoenicia were to be rechoned within the bounds of Tyre
and Sidoni Certainly Nicetas Ohoniates mentions the Syro-
phoenioian cities as far as Antioch. For he, in the story of
John ComeniuS, hath these word8‚¹'Eyvm προσβαλεῖν ταῖς παρὰ
τὴν Ἀντιόχου ἱδρυμένοις, καὶ Ἀγαρηυῶν κατεχομένοις Συροφοι-
νίσσαις πόλεσι· “ He resolved to set upon the Syrophoenician
cities bordering upon Antioch‚ which were possessed by the
Agarones.'' But now, will you reokon those cities as far as
Antioch to be within the jurisdiction of Tyre and Sidon?
But certainly there is nothing hinders but you may reckon
those to be so which Ptolemy esteems to belong to Midland
Phoenicia3 only the scruple is about Caesarea os Paneas,
which is Gaesarea Philippi: and that, we shall see, belonged
to the Decapolitan cities, and may be determined, without
any absurdity, to be within that jurisdiction of 'Pyre and
Sidon, as also Leshem of old, which was the same city, J udges
xviii. 28.

Let one clause of the Talmudists be added; aud then those
things which are spoken may be reduced into a narrower com-
pass, They, reducing the bounds of the land under the second
Temple, fix for a bound ΓἾΟᾫ ΡΞ ΠΒΣὌῙῚἾ ΠΝΒὛ ΝῙἋΖΟἾΠ
“ Tarnegola ¹¹¹ the Upper, which is above Caesarea.’' Observe‚
that Oaesarea is a city of Midland Phoenicia, according to
Ptolemy; and yet Tarnegola‚ which bends more northward,
is within the land of Israel, according to the Hebrews.

So ¹¹ that in this sense, Christ might· be within ‘⁸ the coasts
os Tyre and Sidon‚” and yet be within the limits of the land
of Israel. We must therefore suppose, and that not with-
out reason, that he, when he healed the possessed maid, was,
1. in that country, in t-he outermost coasts of Galilee, which
formerly was called chabul, in the Seventy called Ὅριον,
