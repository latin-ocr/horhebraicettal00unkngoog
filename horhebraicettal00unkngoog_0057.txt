sacrifices, to his host.” The Gloss: “ The inhabitants of
Jerusalem did not let out their houses at a price to those that
came to the feasts, but granted them to them gratis.'' Com-
pare Matt. xxvi. 17.

Nevertheless, the city was divided between the tribe of
J udah and Benjamin, and the distinguishing line went
through the very court of the Temple: “ Whati was in the

lot of J udah3 The mountain of the Temple, the Chambers of ,

them that kept it, t-he Com-ts. And what in the lot of Ben-
jamin? The Porch of the Temple, and the Temple, and the
Holy of Holies. And a line went out of the lot of Judah,
and passed on into the lot of Benjamin‚ and in it was the
altar built.'’ The Gloss; “ The whole breadth of the outmost
Oourt, on the east part, the whole Gourt of the women, the
whole Gourt os Israel, eleven cubits of the Gourt of the
Priests” (these were within the lot of J udah). ‘⁶ From
thence the altar, and thenceforward to the west, is within the
lot of Benjamin.''

south-east corner of the altar had no foundatiom because
that small part was¹ in the portion of J udah, when the whole
altar ought to have been within the portion of Benjamin.

‘⁶ J erusalemm was holy above other cities, girt with walls,
because in it they ate the lighter holy things, and the second
tithe. These also are those things which are spoken of
Jerusalem. They do not permit a dead body to remain a
night in it: they do not carry the bones of a dead body
through it: they do not let out houses in it: in it they do
not let out a place to a proselyto inhabitant (ΞΦἹΠ ἾἎ); in it
they do not allow a sepulchre, except the sepulchres of the
house of David, and the sepulchre of Huldah the prophetess;
which were there from the days of the former prophete: nor
in it do they suffer a dunghill by reason of creeping things;
nor do they bring out· of it into the streete scaffolds set up
‘against the walls by reason of defilement: nor in it do they
make chimneys, by reason of the smoke: nor do they nourish
cocks in it for the sake of the holy things: nor do the priests
