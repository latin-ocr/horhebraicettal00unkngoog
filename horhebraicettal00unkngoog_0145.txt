Ecdippa. Achab. Tyriam. 135

Of Amanah' we shall speak by and by. “ The river (saith
R. Solomon upon the place) is the river of Egypt.”—“ And
Ohezib (saith Rambama) is the name of a place, which
divided between the land of Israel, which they possessed that
came up out of Babylon, and that land which they possessed
that came up out of Egypt. Now that land, which they
possessed that came up out of Egypt, as to the Demai” (or
doubt of tithing), “ is, as it were, without the land.'' Hence
is that in the text, on which he makes this comment, :mm

*nn-m τῶ ἻἹῖΩΞ ῘΒΠΙἍ “ From Ohezib, and beyond, is free
from the Demai.'’

The word chazib, and thzib. 011001 passed into E'och‘ppa,
mording 10 1110 1110111101· 01 1110 Syrian dialect ; 10 which it is
common to change 'c (Zain) of the Hebrews into Ἴ (Daleth.)

Κλίμαξ Τυρίων, “ climax (or tho ladder) of the Tyrians,’' 111
the Talmudists is 1111 nabin, ‘The ladder of Tyro! 011
’111 wir-¹ rumh-nob pm “ Beforeb they came to elimax of
the Tyrians, they forgot all.’'—The discourse is, in the place
cited, about some Romans 00111 10 Rabban Gamaliel, 10
inquire of the J ewish lavv.

Of him also is this story, and of the same place : ‘⁸ Whenc
he went sometime out os Chezib, one came to him, to ask
him of a certain vow of his. He said to him, who went with
him, 'nen him, that we have drunk an Italian quart of wine.
He saith 10 him, Well. He saith 10 111111 11101 asked, Go with
us, until our wine be allayed. When they came bv ΓΙὩῘἎΟῘῚ
ἿἛ to tho ladder of the Tyriam, Rabban Gamaliel came down,
and veils himself, and, sitting, resolved his vow. From this
example we learn these things, that 0 quart of wine makes
one drunk, that the way allays wine,” 810.

Let this be marked by the way, that it 10 said p* ΠΨἮἿ
ΠἾΒΦῺ “ A quart of wine makes drunk :'' and let it be
eompared with what R. Chaia saith, ’111 mm: rma-m
‘⁸ Fourd pots (to be drunk by every one in their sacred
feasts) contain an Italian quart of wine :” and judge how
soberly they carried it in those feasts, if they mingled not
much water with their wine.
