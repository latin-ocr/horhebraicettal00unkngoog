’ In the Targumist it is written ’(ἹἾΒΏ with a Vau, and is
thus pointed ῘἽἾΕΞᾎ, and rendered by the Greek interpretem
Ἐφρῶν, Ephron. But the Masorah tells us it must be read
by Jod‚ ΓἻΕὩ Ephraim. Nor do I question but that it is
the same with J osephus's Ephraim, ancl the 0⁸55? Ephraim
of the Talmudists ¹¹, of which we have diseoursed in our Cho-
rographieal Century, chap. liii.

It is probable it was a eity in the land os Benjamin, as also
was Beth-el, whieh is mentioned at the same time with it.
Now Beth-el was the utmost border of the tribe of Benjamin ¹,
as it lay towards the tribe of Ephraim ἲ. But where this
Ephraim should lie, it is not so plain. Only this o'ur evan·
gelist speaks os it,—that it was “ near the wilderness ;'’ that
is (as it should seem), near the wilderness of J udea, in the
way from Jerusalem to Jerieho.

Sec-r. 11?an tr: ‘Both Marm’ and ’nnn ‘A Maronites!

‘⁴ Tanau* goes a story os a brother and a sister: he was
in :brt um Gmh Halab,· she in ῘἹἾΟ ΠἿἎ Beth Maron.
There happened a fire in his house, that was in Gush Halab;
his sister eomes from Beth Maron, and embraced and kissed
him.”

Now :¹727 mu G'uslz Halab was in the tribe of Asher, as
appears in Menaeoth ³: where there is a story of a most
precious oil bought in Gush Halab, in the tribe of Asher,
sueh as could not be bought in any other plaee.

And so perhaps that may be understood of ῙἹἾὮ ΠἮ Bal»
