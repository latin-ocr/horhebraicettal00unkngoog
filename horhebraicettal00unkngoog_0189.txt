Julius -Bethmidm 179

Herod, called before ⁶ Bethammphtha τ’ of whioh J osephus;
Βηθαραμφθᾶ δὲ, mstis ἦν καὶ αὕτη, τείχει περιλαβὼν, Ἰουλιάδα
ἀπὸ τοῦ αὐτοκράτορος ἀγορεύει τῆς γυναικός· “ At· Betha-
ramphtha‚ which before was the oity’s name, Herod oom-
passed J uliae with a wall, calling it by the name of the
empress.'' The other built by Philip, heretosore called Beth-
saida, os which the same author writes thus: κώμην δὲ
Βηθσαῖδᾶν, πρὸς λίμνῃ τῇ Γεννησαρίτιδι, πόλεως παρασχὼν
ἆξίωμα, πλήθει τε οἰκητόρων καὶ τῇ ἄλλῃ δυνάμει, Ἰουλίᾳ θυ-
γατρὶ τῇ Καίσαρος ὀμόνυμον ἐκάλεσεν· “ Philip b, having raised
the town Bethsaida on the lake of Gennesar-et to the honour
of a city, both in respect of the number of the inhabitante,
and other strength, gave it the same name with J ulia, the
emperor's daughter.’'

'l'hec maps have one J ulias only: not amiss, because they
substitute the name of Bethsaida for the other z—but they
do not well agree about the situation of both. J uliae-Be-
tharamphtha was seated at the very influx of Jordan into the
lake of Gennesaret. For thus J osephus‘¹ ς “ Jordan, having
measured a hundred furlongs more from the lake Samocho-
uitis, μετὰ πόλιν Ἰουλιάδα διεκτέμνει τὴν Γεννησὰρ μέσην, after
the city J ulias, euts the lake of Gennesar in the middle.” Do
not these words argue that Jordan, being now ready to enter
into the lake, did first glide by J uliae? To whieh those
things which are said elsewhere by the same author do
agree. ‘⁶ Sylla (saith he ⁶) eneamped five furlongs from J uliae,
and stopped up the ways 3-—namely‚ that whieh led to Cana,
and that which led to the eastle Gamala. But I, when 1 un-
derstood this, sent two thousand armed men, under J eremias
their eaptain3 οἱ δὴ καὶ χάρακα θέντες άπὸ σταδίου τῆςῚονλιάδος
πλησίον τοῦ Ἰορδάνου ποταμοῦ· and they having enoamped a
furlong from Julias near the river J ordan‚'' διο. Note that,
when they were distant from J ulias a furlong only, they are
but a little way off of Jordan. The maps plaoe it more re-
mote from the influx of Jordan into the lake of Gennesaret
than these words will bear.
