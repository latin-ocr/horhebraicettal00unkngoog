place, to wit, idolatry, and the howlings of infante roasted to
Moloch,——yet so much of the filthiness‚ and of the abomin-
able name remained, that even now it did as much bear to
the lise the representation of hell, as it had done before.

It was the common sink of the whole city3 whither all
filth, and all kind of nastiness‚ met. It was, probably, the
common burying-place of the city (if so be, they did now
bury within so small a distance from the city).· “They shall
bury in Tophet, until there be no more any place‚'' J er. vii. 32.
And there was there also a continual fire, whereby bones, and
other filthy things, were consumed‚ lest they might offend or
infect the city. “ There was a tradition according to the
school of Babba-n J ochanan Ben Zaccai. Theret are two
palm-trees in the valley of Ben-Hinnom, between which a
smoke arises: and this is that we leam, ‘ The palms of the
mountain are fit sor iron.' And, ⁴ This is the door of Ge-
henna.' ”

Some of the Rabbins apply that of Isaiah hither, chap. lxvi,
verse the last: “ They shall go out, and see the dead carcases
of the men, that rebel against me3 for their worm shall not
die, and their fire shall not be quenched.''--“ Those Gentiles
(saith Kimchi upon the place) who come to worship from
mouth to mouth, and from sabbath to sabbath, shall go out
without Jerusalem into the valley of J ehoshaphat‚ and shall
see the carcases of Gog and Magog,” &a And a little after3
“ The just shall go out without Jerusalem into the valley of
Hinnom, and shall see those that rebel‚” 8ιο.

Whatu is to be resolved concerning the ‘ valley of J eho-
shaphat‚’ he himself doubts, and leaves undetermined t “ For
either J ehoshaphat (saith he ¹) here erected some building, or
did some work, or it is called ‘ the valley of J ehoshaphat ' be·—
cause of judgment.” So also J archi [on J oel iii. 2.]; mmmm
ΠἿ *mem “ J ehoshaphat means all one with the ‘ judgments of
the Lord.’” chald. ans-v aasz, “ distributionem Judioii.”
