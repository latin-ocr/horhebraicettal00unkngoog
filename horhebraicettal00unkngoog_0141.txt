West coast os Galilec-O'armel. 131

Κάρμηλον καὶ ποταμόν· “ Carmel and the river.” What
is that river? Kishon, say the maps: for some describe it not
far from Carmel, pouring out itself into the sea: and that not
without a reason, fetched from 1 Kings xviii. 40. But you
must suppose Kishon to flow south of Oarme1‚—not‚ as some
would have it, on the north.

“ The lake Gendevia flows at the foot of Carme13 and out
of it the river Pagida or Bel, mingling glassy sands with its
small shore ;'’ so Plinyd,—who hath moreover these words,
“ Near is the colony of Claudius Caesar, Ptolemais, heretofore
Ace, the town Ecdippa, the white promontory, Tyrus, bereto-
fore an island, &c. Thence are the towns Ide [otherwise
Euhydra]‚ and Sarepta, and Ornithon; and Sidon, skilful in
making glass,'’ 816.

Τ11666 places you may call not so much the bounds of
6611166 66 of Phoenicia : for in Ptolemais itself‚ or Acon, was
the separation and parting of the land of Israel from Phoeni-
cia. Hence Josephus, A2500 δ’ οὔσας τὰς Γαλιλαίας, &a
‘⁸ Phoenice and Syria do compass the two Galilees, the upper
and the nether so called: and Ptolemais and Carmel set
bounds to the country on the west.'’—Whatl do Ptolemais
and Carmel stint the wholef length of Galilee 611 the west?
He had said elsewhere, which we also have produced else-
where, that the land of Nephthali was extended 66 far as

mount Libanus (611 the north) t alas, 116118 far behind Pto-
lemais! And the land Asher was extended so far also: but

“ Ptolemais was the sea-borders of Palestine'’ (to use Pliny’s
words), for from hence onward were the territories of Tyre
and Sidon; and Galilee was not now bounded any longer by
the sea, but by those territories.

We saw in the scheme produced by 116 111 the second
chapter of this little work, wherein the compass of the land
under the second Temple is briefly described, how 5:37* ΝἾἹΦ,
“ Τ116 116116 of Aco” are there set for a bound3 and that in
the sense which we speak of, which afterward also will ap-
pear more. Those names, therefore, which follow in the

mentioned scheme, to wit, l. ΝΒἾΒΖΠ wwep, ΙΙ. affin),
