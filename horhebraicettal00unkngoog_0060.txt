Tho parts ῳ( the Oity. Sion. ”Avo πόλις, tho Upper Oity:
which was on tho north part.

Tanna is one who asser-ts Jerusalem to stand on seven
hills; but whether upon a reason more light, or more obscure,
is not easy to say. “ The whale showed Jonah (saith he ἵ)
the Temple of the Lord‚ as it is said, ‘ 1 went down to the
bottom of the mountains :' whence we learn that Jerusalem
was seated upon seven mountains.” One may sooner almost
prove the thing itself, than approve of his argument. Let
him enjoy his argument to himself ; we must setch the situa-
tion elsewhere.

Πόλις* μὲν ὑπὲρ δύο λόφων ἀντιπρόσωπος ἔκτιστο. “ The city
itself⁸ (saith J osephus) was built upon two hille, divided with
a valley between, whereby, in an opposite aspect, it viewed
itself3 in which valley the buildings, meeting, ended.”

Τῶν δὲ λόφων, ὁ μὲν τὴν ἄνω πόλιν ἔχων, 830. “ Of these
hius, that, which contained the Upper Gity was by far the
higher, and more stretehed out in length: and because it
was very well fortified, it was called by king David Tho
Oastle: ἣ δὲ ἄνω ἀγορὰ πρὸς ἡμῶν, but by us it is called ‘ the
Upper Town.’'’ ⁸

Ἀτερος δὲ, ὁ καλούμενος Ἀκρα, καὶ τὴν κάτω πόλιν ὑφεστὸς,
svo. ‘⁴ But the other, which was called Aera, bearing on it
the lower town, was steep on both sides.''

“ Against this was a third hill [Mor-iam, lower than Aera,
and disjoined from it by a broad valley. But when the As-
moneans reigned, they filled up the valley, desiring that the
Temple might touch the city3 and they took the top of Aera
lower, that the Temple might overlook it.'’

Bezetha and Ophel were other little hills also: of which
in their place, when we shall first have taken a view of these
two, Sion and Aera, and the situation of each.

It is an old disputo, and lasts to this day, whether Sion or
Jerusalem lay on the north part of the city. We place Sion
on the north, convinced by these reasons :—
