stood of one of the chambers of which we have spoken: which
sense the Arabic interpreter seems to follow3 who renders it,

that ‘'‘ -Jesus sat agl-‚0 od: at the yate of the treasury.” But
when it is said that he spake those words ἐν τῷ γαζοφυ-
λακίῳ, in tho troasury, those chambers are wholly excluded,
into which it would be ridiculous to think that they permitted
Christ to enter.

But note, the word Γαζοφυλακιῶν, irasmi-ios, in J osephus,
is the plural number, and that he speaks of the court of the
women, and you will be past doubting that he respected these
chests under the word ersa-mrim .- and you will doubt as
little that Mark looked the same way when you shall have
observed that his speech is of the woman, how both she and
others cast money εἰς τὸ γαζοφυλάκων, into tho treasury ‚-
which, as appears from those things we have produced out of
the Talmudists, was neither customary, nor allowed to do into
other Corbans.

This court, indeed, is commonly called in the J ewish writers,
0³27} ΠἾῘῺ the court of tho women3 not that women only
entered in there, but because women might not go fut-then
in the same sense as the outward court is called ‘ the court
of the Gentiles} not that heathens only might enter there,
but because they might not go further. 'l'hat court was also
most ordinarily called ΠἮΠ nr! the Mountain ‘os tho Templo ‚-
so this also whereof we are treating was called Γαζοφυλάκιου,
the treasuvy.

When, therefore, it is said by St. Mark that J esus sat
κατέναντι τοῦ γαζοφυλακίου, over-ayaimi tho treasury, it
comes to this, that he sat under the walk before which
those chests were placed. And when John saith, “ Jesus
spake these words in the treasury,” it is all one as if he had

said, ⁴ He spake these words in the court of the women ;’ .

yea, in that place where those chests were, that that place
might be distinguished from others which were in that court;
for in every corner of that court there was a little court, each
one called by its own name, as appears in the places written
in the margin k,
