Tun collector of the Hebrew Gippi, Grave-stanes, hath

this passage concerni the fountain of Etam: Γ) ἼἾἿΞ

''uw mov ΓΚ) nats-mm& ἷἹὋΠ “ ln the way betwixt Hebron
and Jerusalem, is the fountain Eunu, from whence the waters
are conveyed by pipes into the great pool at J erusalem.'' It
is so translated by the learned Hottinger, who also himself
adds, “ Ι suppose here is meant the probatica, or the pool by
the Sheep-gate.”

The Rabbins often and again tell us os an aqueduct from
the fountain of Etam to Jerusalem. But it may very well be
doubted whether that fountain be in the way to Hebron;
or whether those waters ran into the pool by the Sheep-gate.
For,

Ι. 11· the fountain of Etam be the same with the waters ·
of Nephtoah, mentioned Josh. xv, 93 which the Gloss sup-
posethf (where it is treating about the fountain of Etam)‚
then it lieth quite in another quarter from Hebron 3 for He-
bron lies on the south, and Nephtoah on the west.

ΙΙ. The waters streaming from the fountain Etam were
not conveyed into the city, but into the Temple: which
might be abundantly made out from the Talmudists‚ if there
were any need sor it. And probably Aristeas hath respect
to this aqueduct: ’Ύδατος δὲ ἆυέκλειπτός ἐστι σύστασις, διο.
“ There is a confluenee os water that never fails [speaking of
the Temple]; asssif there were a great spring within naturally
flowing: and sor the space of five furlongs (as appeared every-
where about the Temple), there were certain receptacles
made, under the earth, by a wondrous and uuspeakable
art '' Andg a little after. · “ They led me out of the city
above four furlongs, where one bade me lean down my head
at a certain place, and listen to the noise that the flow of
waters there made‚” &c

In a word, to any one that is conver-sant in the Talmudic
authore, nothing can be more plain than that the aqueduct
from the fountain of Etam was into the Temple, and not into
