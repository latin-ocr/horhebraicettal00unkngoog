“'Oposy τὸ προσαγορευόμενον Ἐλαιῶν, ὃ καὶ τῆς πόλεως ἀντι-
κρὺς κείμενον, ἀπέχει στάδια πέντε. The mount called the
mount of Olives, lying over against the city, is distant five
furlongs.” But Luke saith, Acts i. 12, “ Then they returned
from the mount called olivet, ὅ ἐστιν ἐγγὺς Ἰερουσαλὴμ σαβο
βάτου ἔχον ὁδόν· “ which is near Jerusalem, a sabbath-day's
journey. '’ But now a sabbath-day's Journeyz contained eight
furlongs, or a whole mile. Neither yet, sor all this, doth
Luke fight against J osephus For this last measures the
space to the first foundation of Olivet· the other, to that
plaoe of Olivet, where our Saviour aseended. The first foot
of the mount was distant five surlongs from the eity3 but
Christ, being about to ascend, went up the mountain three
furlongs farther.

The mount had its name from the Oliva-trees, however
other trees grew in it; and that, because the number of
these perhaps was greater, and the fruit better. Among
other trees, two oedars are mentioned, or rather two mon-
sters os cedars. ‘⁸ Two ὃ cedars (they say) were in the mount
of Olivet, under one of whieh were four shops‚ where all
things needful for purifications were sold: out of the other,
they fetehed‚ every mouth, forty seahs'' (oertain mensures)
‘⁴ of pigeons‚ whence all the women to be purified were sup-

It is a dream like that story, that, beneath this mountain,
all the dead are to be raised. “ When the dead shall live
again (say theyb)‚ mount Olivet is to be rent in two, and all
the dead of Israel shall come out thenoe; yea, those right-
eous persons, who died in eaptivity‚ shall be rolled under
the earth, aud shall come forth under the mount of Olivetss'

There was a place in the mount, direetly opposite against
