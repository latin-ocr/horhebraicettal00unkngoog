4 PREFAGE.

they are J ews,-—yet certainly they are worthy of examination‚
and may have leave to relate, as they are chorographers.

When, in the reading of these writers, I collected all those
things, which I met with relating hitherto, and compared
them with the maps and tracts already published‚ I plainly
saw, if my eyes deceived me not, that very many things
might be fetched and drawn out of these authors, which
might correct the maps; very many things, which might
discover places unknown3 very many, which might fix those,
that were uncertain; very many, which might illustrate
those, that were certain3 and infinite things, which might
‘ some way or other hold out a light to chorography. And
if any dexterous and h'appy artist, versed in the Talmudic
writings, and skilled in chorography‚ would undertake a task
and work of this nature, l should expect from such a hand a
more polite and correct map‚ and a more full, plain, and cer-
tain description of the lands of Israel, than any the Christian
world hath yet seen.

We are far from daring to enter upon such a thing: nor
is our hand sufficiently taught for so great a work, or, indeed,
teachable. That only, which we have attempted in the fol-
lowing century, was this; that, by some instance, we might
a little demonstrate those things, which we speak concerning
the writers of the Talmud: and that some specimen might
be set before our eyes, whereby the reader may judge of their
study, style, use, benefit, in the thing propounded. Nor did
we think it the part 'of modesty‚ to burden the reader with
too much of those things, which perhaps are of dubious
acceptation with him3 nor the part of prudence‚ to expose

and commit, together at once, all that we have, to one wind
and fortune.
