Galilee through the midst of the coasts of Decapolis.” The
difficulty lies in this3 that supposing by the ‘coasts os Tyre
and Sidon.q a place near the gates of Sidon is to be under-
stood, of which before, it can scarcely be conceived how
Christ went through the middle of Decapolis to the sea of
Galilee, unless it be supposed that Decapolis was within
Galilee.

Hence Borchardt certainly, and others that follow him,
seem to be induced to number these towns of Galilee for
Decapolitan towns, Tiberias, Sephet‚ Kedesh -Naphtali,
Hazor, capernaum, Gaesarea Philippi, J otopata‚ Bethsaida,
Chorazin, Scythopolis. Upon whose credit Baroniusu writes
thus: ‘⁶ The province of Decapolis (saith he) was placed iu
the same Galile03 so called, because there were ten cities
in it, among which one was reckoned Capernaum.” Con-
fidently enough indeed, but without any ground. Pliny
much otherwise: “ There is joined to it (saith hex), on the
side of Syria, the region of Decapolis, from the number os
the towns, in which region all do not keep the same towns.
Yet most do. Damascus aud Opoto‚ watered with the river
Chrysorrhoa, fruitful philadelphia, Raphana, all lying back-
wards towards Arabia: Scythopolis (heretofore called Nysa,
from father Bacchus's nurse being there buried), from Scy·
thians drawn down [and planted] there: Gaddara, [the river]
Hieromiax gliding by it, and that which is now called Hippon
Dion, Pella rich in waters, Galasa. Canatha. The tetrar-
chies run between these cities, and compass them about,
which are like to kingdoms‚ and are divided into kingdoms.
namely, Trachonitis, Paneas, in which is Gaesarea, with the
fouutain before spoke of, Abila, Arca, Ampeloessa.”

Whom should we believe? Borchard and his followers place
all Decapolis within Galilee, being extended the whole length
of Galilee, and adjacent to Jordan, aud on the shore of the
sea of Gennesaret. Pliny and his followers place it all in the
country beyond Jordan, except only Scythopolis.

In Scythopolis both parties agree, and I, in this, with both:
but in others 1 agree wit-h Borchardus hardly in any, and not
with Pliny in all. In them, it is absurd to reckon' the most
