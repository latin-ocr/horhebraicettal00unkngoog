Jonathan upon Numb. xxxiv. 8. 381

strange thing the Targumist should be no better read in cho-
rography, than to mistnke the reading of this word mr! in
this place. For it is plain he read ΠὩΠ Okammoth, or the
“ warm baths of Tiberias, ’³ when it is really Hamath, or
‘ Antioch.’ He is a blind geographer that brings down the
borders of the land of Israel to Tiberias, unless he means
something beyond our capacity to apprehend.

IV. ”5103 ΓἾΓἹ m From the two sidem] It is plain bere
also, that he took m Zodad, appellatively for '73 a side.

v. mm arr wan-1:³7 To eodm Bar Zaamaa .·] If he
deth not blunder‚ we do. We only take notice, that mm
Zaamalo. and &55:³20 Simone, do signify indiynation, and
advocate, perhaps in the same sense that ἾῚἉὍΕ) and ἾἸἎἺΔΡ
are often used, in the Rabbinical writers, for accuser and
advocato but what it should signify in him, he must shew
himself an OEdipus, or somebody else.

VI. ΟἸΠΩἸῚἿἻ Divackonuc .·] I suspect this to be Greek, viz.
Διαυχέυιος. By which is intimated some back of a mountain,
either lifting itself up, or stretching itself out. And this I
suspect the more by the Jerusalem version upon ver. ¹5 ε

τηεψ-ιω subn wizo nuspa-42 anunm which 1 would
thus render, ‘⁶ The borders shall be to the Διαυχένιον of the

snowy mountain of Oaesarea.” Where by caesarea, is to be
understood Oaesarea Philippi; where indeed the bordei· of
the north part of the land did not end but ext-,ended higher
and beyond, ΓἾΟῬ p: ΠῘἏΥΟᾎ ³⁸7 ΠΝ Ψ &ihm-015³) “even
to upper Tarnegola, which is above caesarem ” i. e. πρὸς
αὐχένα ιο tho neck of the mount Antilibanus.

The whiteness [13⁸2] of Libanus gave it its name, both of
Libanus and the ‘ Mountain of snow,' because its whitenm
was occasioned by the snows upon it. [But by what deri·
vation ‘ Oyndus ' should, in the Syrien language, denote
whitmess, I confess it is beyond my skill in that tongue
to know-3 which yet Solinus affirmsn it dotlu “ Whatever is
white (saith he), the Syrians, in their language, called Cydnus;
whence the name given to the river Cydnus.”] And it is
worthy noting, that Lebanon, in the Hebrew text, is often, by
the Greek interpreters, rendered Ἀντιλίβανος, ‘ Antilibanus?
So Dent. xi. 24, Josh. i. 4, &c.; and sometimes by the 'l'al-

. mudists, &bna Bata.
