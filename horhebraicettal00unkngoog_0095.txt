In <1 the place, marked in the margin, they are treating
concerning removing a sepulchre, seated in an inconvenient
place, that it might not pollute any man. Examples are

sons of Huldah, which were within Jerusalem, and were not
moved out of their places. “ Hence it appears (saith R.
Akibah)‚ that there was a certain cave, whereby filth and
uncleanness was carried down into the valley of Kedron.''

the valley of Kedron: and it was sold to the gardeners to

city.

metaphorical, and is transferred to denote the place of the
damned. Under the second Temple, when those things were
