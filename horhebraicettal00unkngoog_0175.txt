Usha. 165

11. “ 'romb fortified from the days of J oshua: Old Ket-
sarah, which belongs to Tsippor; and Chakrah, which be-
longs to Gush; Calab3 and J odapath the old [Jotopata];
and Gamala⁰‚” διο. 'Phe Gloss is, ‘⁶ Ketsarah is the name
of a little city without Tsippor.'' Perhaps that which we
cited above relatos to this, pain& ‘vm mm? ³³2 “ 'rho son.
os Ketzirah (or the harvest), of Tsippor.'’

III. “ Sometimed a fire happened in the court of J osi Ben
Simai in Shihin, and the inhabitants of Ketsarah‚ which be-
longs to Tsippor, came down to quench it; but he permitted
them not, saying, ‘ Let the exactor exact his debt.' Presently
a cloud gathered together above the fire3 and rains fell, and
put it out. The sabbath being finished‚ he sent money to
every one of them.”

J osephus e mentions also Γαρεισίμης, G'an’simes, distant
twenty furlongs from Tsippor.

In like manner, Ἀσαμῶυ, τὸ μεσαίτατον Γαλιλαίας ὅρος, ὃ
κεῖται ἄντικρυς τῆς Σεπφώρεως· “Asamonf, a mountain in the
middle os Galilee, which lies over against Tsippor.”

O H ΑΡ. LXXXIV.s

Nm& Usha.

«ι 'raah sanhedrim went omnm& κωκυ-ι &mab mam
from Jabneh to Usha, and from Usha to &epharaamss’ The
Gloss is, “ To J abneh in the days of Rabban Jochanan (Ben
Zaccai); to Usha in the days of Rabban Gamaliel: but they
went back from Usha to J abneh: but in the days of Rabban
Simeon they returned.”

We do not apprehend the reason why Rabban Gamaliel
went thither; whatsoever it were, either some disturbance
raised b'y the Romans, or indignation that R. Eleazer Ben
Azariah should be president with him, or some other reason,
—certainly the abode there was but small, either Gamaliel
himself returning to J abneh after some time, or R. Akibah, who
succeeded in his chair.
