Sscr. II.⁸—Sepharad‚ where.

Tne Italian interpreter for Sepharad retains Zarphath:
for so he3 “ Et i transferiti de questo esercito de figlioli de
Israel, che sono de Chenahanei‚ in fino a Zarphath, et i
transferiti di Jerusalem, che sono in Zarphath‚” &a Whe-
ther too warily or too unwarily he hath thus done, let him
look to that himself.

The Greek hath Ἐφραθᾶ, Ephraim, with which the Ara·
bian interpreter agrees. But the Syriae with the Targumist,
Spain. 'Phe Vulgar, Bosphorus, confusedly3 besides that it
makes the proposition 2 a radical letter. And yet Nobilius
hath this passage: “ St. Jerome tells us, the other interpreters
agreed with the Hebrew word Sepharad‚ which he rendered
Bosphorus.” lf he means that all agreed in acknowledging
the word Sepharad, he tells us no news3 but who agreed
with his word Bosphorus?

Ι must confess, Sepharad is not a place so obvious as
Zarephath, nor can any thing be offered in it but conjecture
only: and if 1 might be allowed my gaces, 1 would look for
Sepharad in Edom rather than in Spain: and that because
Obadiah prophesies against the Edomites properly so called.
Whereas, therefore, he tells us, That the captivity of Israel,
in Sarepta of the Phoenicians, shall possess the land of the
Oanaanites‚ it is probable he means, by the captivity in Se-
pharad, those captives in Edom who shall possess the cities
of the south. The Zarphathani, or Sareptani were of the
north, the Sepharadani of the south, amongst the Ἐρεμβοι b,
Erembi. Οὓς εἰκὸς λέγειν τοὺς Τρογλοδύτας Ἀραβας· “ whom
you may right-ly call the Troglodyte Arabs,” saith ’Strabo ⁰3

Horim‚ by ill use, might form itself into Eremb.

Ifd we consider that the Jews do generally by Edom un-
derstand the Roman empire, and indeed· all the Christian
nations in the west, we shall easily perceive why they fix
