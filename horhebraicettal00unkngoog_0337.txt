Ssc'r. I.—D2fflront readinys, Βηθανία and Βηθαμαρά.
ΙΤ is observed by all that trent upon this evangelist, that
the reading doth vary in some oopi0s3 and 'this instance is
alleged for one:

Tafirab ἔν Βηθαβαρᾷ ἐγένετο· ἐν ἄλλοις δὲ ἀντιγράφοις, ἐν
Βηθανίᾳ· “These things were done in Bethabara ,· but in other
copies it is in Bethany.’'

But Drusius3 “ The Vulgar Greek copies have it in
Bethabara, which Epiphanius, in the place above mentioned,
calls Bothamara. Ταῦτα ἐν Βηθαμαρᾷ ἐγένετο· ἐν ἄλλοις
δὲ ἀντιγράφοις, ἐν Βηθανίᾳ. Of this reading Petavius is
silent.”

It might easily happsn that Bethabara should change
into Bethamara, partly, considering “ the affinity of the
characters, which, saith hs, tanta est in antiqua Scriptum,
ut vix discerni possit μΰ ὲ βῆτα, st eontra? “is so great in
ancient writings, that μῦ and βῆτα ean hardly bs distin-
guishedf'* partly, that the alternate uss of D (Mem) and 2
(Both) ιε so very common in those countries.
