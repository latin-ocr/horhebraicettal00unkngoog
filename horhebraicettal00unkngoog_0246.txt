a very little space from Jerusalem, and that it was situate
on the south side of the city: Ι say, “ a little space from
Jerusalem ;'' for it had been a burden to the inhabitants
dwelling about the city not to be borne, if their oxen or
smaller cattle, upon any occasion straying away and taken in
stray, should immediately become consecrated, and that the
proper owner should no longer have any right in them. But
this tower seems to be situate so near the city, that there
was no town round about within that space. We say else,
that that tower was on the south side of the city; and that

upon the credit, (shall I say 2) or mistake of the Seventy
interpreters.

Hans, reader, Ι will resolve you a riddle in the Seventy, in
Gen. xxxv. [16.] In Moses the story of Jacob in that place
is thus: ‘⁶ They went from Beth-eh and when it was but a
little space ιο Ephrath, Rachel travailed,” διο. And aster-
ward [21]; ‘⁴ Israel went on and pitched his tabernaclo
beyond the tower Edar.''

The Seventy invert the order os the history, and they
make the eucamping of Jacob beyond Migdal Eder- to be
before his coming to the place where Rachel died. For thus
they write: Ἀπάρας δὲ Ἰακὼβ ἐκ Βαιθὴλ, ἔπηξε τὴν σκηνὴν
αὐτοῦ ἐπέκεινα τοῦ πύργου Γαδέρ. Ἐγένετο δὲ ἡνίκα ἤγγισεν
εἷς Χαβραθᾶ τοῦ ἐλθεῖν εἰς τὴν Ἐφραθᾶ, ἔτεκε Ῥαχὴλ, διο.
“ And Jacob, departing from Beth-el, pitched his tent over-
against the tower Gader. And it came to pass when he
approached to Chabratha to come to Ephratha, Rachel tra·
vailed,'' &c

I suspect, unless I fail in my conjecture, that they inverted
the order of the history, fixing their eyes upon that Migdal
Eder which was very near Jerusalem. For when Jacob
travelled from Beth-el to the place os Rachel’s sepulchre,
that tower was first to be passed by, before one could come
to the place; and when Jacob in his journey travelled south-
ward, it is very probable that tower was on that quarter of
the city. -

There was, indeed, a Migdal Eder near Beth-lehem, and
