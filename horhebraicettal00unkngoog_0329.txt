Emmaus. Timnath. Mount Gitona. 319

pipes into the Temple. This was in the same quarter from
Jerusalem with our Emmaus: so that our Ἐμμαοῦς may as
well be derived from ΠΌΝ Ammath, a ohannel os waters, as
well as the other Ἀμμαοῦς from ΠὩΠ &hammam the warm
bathe. But this I leave to the reader's judgment.

In memory of this place, let us record a story out of Sige-
vert’s Chronicle, in the reigns of Theodosius and Valenti-
nianus: “ At this time, in a gan-ison in Judea called Em-
maus, there was a perfect child born. From the navel up-
ward he was divided, so that he had two breasts and two
heads‚ eit-her of which had their proper senses belonging to
them: the one ate when the other did not, the one slept
when the other was awake. Sometime they slept both to-
gethem they played one with another-3 they both wept‚ and
would strike one another. They lived near two years 3 and
after one had died the other survived about four days.'’

If this two-headed child was the issue of a Jew‚ thenh

· might that question be solved which is propounded‚ (Mena-

coth, fol. 37. 1.) Ε’ὯᾺἾ *m ³³7 ww ’D If any one should
have two heads, ἶἾιὲἯΠ ΠὊὩ ῙΠὉ nrm on which qt* tho fore-
heads should the phylacteriae be bound 2 No mean scruple
indeed. But let us have from the Glossator as consider-
able a story: “ Asmodeus produced, from under the pave-
ment before Solomon‚ a man with two heads. He marries a
wife, and beg'ot children like himself, with two heads, and
like his wife, with one. When the patrimony comes to be
divided, he that bad two heads requires a double portionz
and the cause was brought before Solomon to be decided
by him.''

As to that Thamna, or Timnath, which Josephus‚ in the
place above quoted, makes mention of, it is disputed in So-
tah, fol. 17. 1 ; where “ Rabh asserts that there were two
Timnaths‚ one iu Judea, and the other that of Samson.”
We all know of a third of that name, J oshua's Timnath,
viz. Timnath-serah in mount Ephraim, where Joshua was
buried, J osb. xxiv. 30. Here give the Rabbins a little play,
and let them trifle by transposing the names of rme> Ser-ah,
and mn Chares, and from thence ground a fiction, that the
image os the sun was fixed upon the sepulchre of J oshna, in

¹¹ Leusden's edition, vol. ii. p. 481.
