Oourt of tlte Women. 67

“ Theb Chol [5³13] or Ante-murale’' (or second encloeure
about the Temple), “ was more sacred than the Gourt of the
Gentiles: sor hither no heathen, nor any unclean by that
which died of iteelf, nor who lay with a menstruoue woman,
might come.”

“ Fromc hence they aecended into the Oourt of the Women
by twelve steps.’'

On‘¹ the east it had only one gate, called in the Holy
Scriptum, Ὡραία, ‘ Beautiful,’ Acts iii. 2. In J oeephue ⁶, the
‘ Corinthian' gate: Τῶν δὲ πυλῶν, διο. saith he; “of the
gates, nine of them were every where overlaid with gold and
silver, likewiee the poete, and the lintela. But one, without
the Temple, made of Corinthian brace, did much exceed‚ in
glory, those, that were overlaid with silver and gold. And

two gates of every court were each thirty cubite high, and
fifteen broad.”

On the south was only one gate also, and one on the
north: and galleriee‚ or court-walke within, joining to the
wall, in the same manner as in the outer court, but notf
double. Before which were the treaeuriee placed, or thirteen
cheete ε, called by the TalmudistS, ΠἸἾΞἸΦ δ’]ιοΡῘιανοίΙις in
which was put the money offered for the various eervices os
the Temple; and, according to that variety, the cheets had
various titlee written on them: whence the offerer might
know into which to put his offering, according to his quality.

Uponh one was inscribed, ῙἾῊΠ ῬῖἷφἿΠ “ The new she·
kole ;” into which were cast the ehekels of that year. Upon
another, ΓρἿΠῃ ‘byn “ The old shekele ;” into which were

thered the ehekels owing the last year. Upon another,
³ Tm 0³2³? “ pigeons and turtles.” Upon another, ‚4729
“ The burnt sacrifice.” Upon another, 0³33? “ The wood.”
Upon another, rma& “ Frankincense.” Upon another,
flffffilb ἎΓΠ “ Gold for the propitiation.” And six chests
had written on them, m'l] “ Voluntary sacrifice.”
