ὊἸἾὩ may not unfltly be rendered a Mau-onita, though not
in the same sense wherein it is now commonly understood3
but as signifying ‘ one coming from the town Maron, or
Beth Maron) Render it Mau-omium, and then there is no
difficulty.

And to this, perhaps, may refer that passage in Rosh
Hashanahc: In the beginning of the year, 0³73? *Nn ¹:⁸2

“ Where the way was so narrow, that two could not walk
abreast together, for there was 0 deep vale on each side of

Naveh‚ a town near it, dwelt J ewsf 3 and these were afflicted
by them.” And elsewhere, “ These are the names of places
where the sinners of 1110 Gentiles, of Moab and Ammon, &c.,
did dwell.'’

By the way, it is to be observed that the word, which in
other places is written ἾΕῚΠ Ohepkar, or :Chippam in Schir
Babbathi is written ΠΒἿΠ Okephuh. Whence in Shemoth

If the distance of the other places might be determined
