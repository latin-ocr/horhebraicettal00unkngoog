Norc indeed is it much wonder, that Bethamara should
change into Bethania, since Bethamara being writ 1¹1³:
Νηῦν, signifies a place os wool‚· and Bethania, being writ
&³:249 ΠὮ, signifies a place of sheep.

But it seems very strange how Bethabara should ever
change into Bethany, unless upon some such occasion as
these:

Either that Bethabara might be taken for the same with
ΠἾΞΠ ΠἮ, i. e. the house of exposition, or the school (in which
sense we meet with &³³52 and &DWUM whence for expli-
cation it is annexed, by some hand or other in the margin d,
ἉὋΠ w: the house of tradition, or doctrine .· as if the evan·
gelist were to be understood in this manner3 ‘⁶ These things
were done or disputed in a certain school beyond Jordan,
where John was baptizing.'’ And so that worde ΝὋΠ w:
being so very known and obnoxious‚ might steal from the
margin into the text and common use.

Or perhaps, secondly, upon the suspicion of a tautology, if
Bethabara and Πέραυ τοῦ Ἰορδάνου should be found together,
ΓΓῬΠ ἾΒὩ mm? 17³2: because ΠἿΒὩ rr: may be looked
upon as the same thing with “ a place beyond Jordan τ ”
therefore, they might substitute the word Bethany as sig-
'nifying ‘ Batanea' or ‘ Bashan' to some such sense as this;
‘⁸ These things were done in Batanea beyond J ordan,” διο.
But it is our province at present to inquire rather into the

⁸ situation of Bethabara, than into the original and deriva-

tion of Bethany.

Secr. 11.—Tlae noted passayes ocor Jordan.

Axona the various ways of writing Βηθαβαρᾶ in Hebrew,
these two especially deserve our consideration at present:
‘ Beth-harah,' which we meet with in Judg. vii„ and Beth-
abara, or a placo of passam, where they passed over Jordan.
*They must both come under our inquiry, whiles we are secking
the place in hand; and, first, of the latter.

Doubtless there was no part of Jordan but might be passed
by boat from one side to the other, as men's different occa·
sions might call them3 but we are now considering the public
